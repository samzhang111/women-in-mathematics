QUINN, Grace (Shover). December 20, 1906–February 4, 1998.
Ohio State University (BA 1926, BS 1926, MA 1927, PhD 1931).

Carolyn Grace Shover was the second of two daughters of Margaret Seeds (1859–
1944) and Cyrus F. Shover (1857–1939), both natives of Ohio. She was born in Grove
City, Ohio, just outside Columbus. Her parents attended rural schools and married
in about 1892. Her mother, later described by Quinn as a homemaker who was
an expert seamstress, held a teacher’s certiﬁcate, while her father was a carpenter
and was in the lumber business. Her older sister, (Rebekah) Ruth Shover (1894–
1975), was also born in Grove City. Ruth Shover later earned a bachelor’s degree
in education from Ohio State University and a master’s degree from what is now
Case Western Reserve University, and was a high school teacher. The family was
living in Columbus, Ohio, by 1900.

Grace Shover attended public schools in Columbus from 1912 to 1922, when
she entered Ohio State University at age sixteen as a commuter. She graduated in
1926, having earned a BA with honors and a BS in education. She was a member
of Pi Lambda Theta, an education honorary association. Shover remained at Ohio
State and earned a master’s degree in 1927, after having served as an assistant in
psychology during 1926–27. Her master’s thesis was on scoring methods in college
reading tests. She continued her work at Ohio State with a University scholarship
in mathematics 1927–29; she also studied at the University of Chicago during the
summer of 1928.

Shover taught mathematics for the next four years while also completing her
graduate work in mathematics. She was an instructor at Connecticut College for
Women 1929–33. During this period, in 1931, she received a PhD in mathematics
from Ohio State University, with a dissertation in the area of number theory in
the context of a linear associative algebra, written under the direction of C. C.
MacDuﬀee. During 1933–34 she worked at the Federal Reserve Bank in Cleveland,
Ohio.

In the fall of 1934 Grace Shover was one of four women who was at Bryn Mawr
College on a scholarship or fellowship to study with Emmy Noether, who had come
to Bryn Mawr from Germany the previous fall. The others were Marie Weiss (PhD
1928 Stanford), Olga Taussky (PhD 1930 University of Vienna), and Ruth Stauﬀer
(McKee), who was a doctoral student at Bryn Mawr and who would receive her
degree the following June. Shover had an Emmy Noether fellowship, which paid
for her room, board, and tuition. Her account of some events of the year at Bryn
Mawr and especially of the sudden death of Noether in April 1935 was presented
at a 1982 AWM symposium on Noether and published as 1983. During the next
year, 1935–36, Shover was a teacher at the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, a position
she had taken the previous winter with the intention of continuing her studies with
Noether. She said in 1982, “Unfortunately, my plans were shattered by her untimely
death” (1983, 140).

In the summer of 1936 Shover attended the International Mathematical Congress
in Oslo. Before the Congress she traveled to G¨ottingen and attended lectures by
Helmut Hasse. She left G¨ottingen early to assist Anna Pell Wheeler, who was in
a wheelchair after having fallen in Hamburg, in her travels from Copenhagen to
Oslo. Shover had planned to travel after the Congress with a group led by Mayme

Logsdon. However, the group left before the Congress ended, and Shover joined
them a day late in order to hear a talk by Olga Taussky.

Shover was an instructor at the New York College for Teachers (now State Uni-
versity of New York at Albany) for the year 1936–37 and then at Carleton College
in Minnesota for ﬁve years, 1937–42. In June 1940 she wrote to Helen Owens that
teaching “does not leave much time for original work. I have 3 papers in the ﬁre
and wish to ﬁnish them this summer” (Owens Papers). It appears that one of these
papers was published the following year.

On June 9, 1942, in Cleveland, Ohio, Grace Shover married Robert Byron Quinn,
who had been an instructor of physics at Carleton the previous three years. Robert
Quinn, born on February 6, 1907, in Valparaiso, Indiana, received his bachelor’s
degree and master’s degree from Indiana University in 1929 and 1930, respectively,
and his doctorate in physics from the University of Chicago in 1941. After their
marriage the Quinns moved to Washington, D.C., where from 1942 to 1945 Robert
Quinn was a staﬀ member and project engineer for the US Naval Research Labo-
ratory. In 1942 Grace Quinn was a cryptanalyst for the US Navy, and from 1943
to 1945 she was a research assistant for the National Defense Research Commit-
tee. From 1942 to 1944 she was also a part-time lecturer at George Washington
University.

Robert Quinn continued his professional work with the US Naval Research Lab-
oratory as unit head 1945-48 while also an instructor at the University of Mary-
land 1945–46. He then worked in the navy’s Bureau of Ordnance, Bureau of Naval
Weapons, and the Naval Air Systems Command before his retirement in 1970. He
was a staﬀ member and mathematician in evaluation and analysis with the Bureau
of Ordnance 1948–60, was group head in Weapons System Analysis with the Bu-
reau of Naval Weapons 1960–66, and was branch head of the Naval Air Systems
Command 1966–70.

The Quinns had two daughters, both born in Washington, D.C.: Margaret Edith
in May 1946, and Carolyn Roberta in August 1949. Margaret Quinn later earned a
bachelor’s degree in mathematics and computer science from Iowa State University
and a master’s degree in computer science from Rutgers University; in 1981 she had
completed the course work for her PhD and was working as a computer scientist
for Bell Telephone Laboratories in Highland Park, New Jersey. Carolyn Roberta
Quinn earned a bachelor’s degree in English Literature from Ripon College and a
certiﬁcate from the Morven Park International Equestrian Institute in Leesburg,
Virginia, and was working as an equestrian in 1981.

Grace Quinn interrupted her career for just over a decade while the children were
young before resuming full-time teaching in 1956 at American University in Wash-
ington, D.C. She spent the next fourteen years there, ﬁrst as assistant professor,
then as associate professor, and ﬁnally as professor from 1963 until her retirement
in 1970. She continued as an adjunct professor for a year after her retirement.
Her teaching at American University included the complete range of undergrad-
uate courses as well as modern algebra and matrix theory at the graduate level.
Quinn also directed several master’s theses while at American University. She was
a member of Phi Kappa Phi, an honor society for scholarship when she was at
American.

In her 1981 Smithsonian questionnaire, Quinn described her religious aﬃliation
as Congregational since 1928. She described one of her hobbies as playing the piano

and noted that she took piano and belonged to a group with similar interests. She
was also interested in needlework, sewing (had done tailoring including a winter
coat), and some gardening. At that time she was treasurer of the American Uni-
versity Women’s Association; was secretary of the Women’s Guild at her church,
the Westmoreland Congregational Church in Bethesda; was on the executive board
of the Bethesda Garden Club; and was vice president of a social club. She also
noted that earlier she had been a Republican, later a Democrat, and most recently
a registered Republican. Other activities mentioned later were membership in the
Appalachian Trail Club and volunteer work for Meals on Wheels.

In July 1991 the Quinns moved to Foxdale Village, a Quaker retirement com-
munity in State College, Pennsylvania. There they belonged to the Faith United
Church. Less than two years later, on March 21, 1993, Robert B. Quinn was in an
automobile accident; after nearly seven months in a coma he died on October 3.
According to the Washington Post obituary, he had been a passenger in a car that
was hit broadside when another car ran a stop sign. In February 1998 Grace Quinn
died at ninety-one of a heart ailment in Foxdale Village in State College, Pennsyl-
vania. She was survived by their two daughters and a grandchild. Inurnment was
at Graceland Cemetery in Valparaiso, Indiana, where her husband was buried.
