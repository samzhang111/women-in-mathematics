SAGAL, Mary Helen (Sznyter). June 21, 1893–March 24, 1975.
University of California (BA 1915, MA 1916, PhD 1918).

Mary Helen Sznyter was born in Woodhaven, New York, the only surviving child
of three children born to Mary (Mogilska) (b. 1864) and Valentine Sznyter (1851–
1948), both natives of Poland. In 1900 the family was living in Withee, Wisconsin,
where her father was a farmer. Her parents had been married twenty years, and
her father had immigrated to the United States in 1890 and her mother in 1891.
At some point the family moved to California.

Mary Helen Sznyter graduated from Berkeley High School in June 1911 and
did all of her undergraduate and graduate work at the University of California
in Berkeley, starting in 1911 as a student in social sciences. The following year, on
November 2, 1912, she married John Boleslaw Sagal, then a student in commerce at
the university. John Sagal was born in about 1887 in Bialystok, Poland, apparently
with the family name of Sawoinewsky according to his draft registration form for
World War I. He was in residence at the University of California for the ﬁrst half
of 1912–13, and his name does not appear in later catalogues of students. In 1917
he was a surveyor’s helper, and in 1930 he was a civil engineer in Alameda County,
California.

Mary Helen Sznyter continued to use the name Sznyter as a student and on
her mathematical publications. By 1912–13 she had switched from social sciences
to natural sciences, and for the year 1913–14 she held a Levi Strauss scholarship
for the third congressional district. She received her bachelor’s degree from the
University of California in 1915. The following year she was a graduate student and
a reader in mathematics. She completed the work for her master’s degree in May
1916 with a master’s thesis directed by J. H. McDonald. A paper based on her thesis
appeared in the Monthly the following year. The Sagals’ only child, a daughter,
Bernice Elizabeth, was born on April 21, 1916, a month before her mother received
her master’s degree.

Sznyter continued her studies at California, with her major subject mathemat-
ics and her minor subject astronomy. In the former she had Theory of Algebraic
Surfaces with D. N. Lehmer, Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable with B.
M. Woods and F. Irwin, Logic of Mathematics with B. A. Bernstein, Seminar in
Mathematics with McDonald, and Elliptic Functions with C. A. Noble. In her mi-
nor subject, she had courses in Theoretical Astronomy and in Celestial Mechanics
with A. O. Leuschner. She was again a reader in mathematics 1917–18, her ﬁnal
year at the University of California.

According to the mathematics department at the University of California, Mary
Helen Sznyter’s dissertation advisor was J. H. McDonald who chaired the committee
for her public ﬁnal examination in May 1918. In her dissertation she expresses her
gratitude to D. N. Lehmer “whose course on algebraic surfaces of three dimensional
space served to arouse the interest in the study of such surfaces and has been a
foundation for much that is included here.”

At the time of the census in 1930, John and Mary Sagal were living in Eden
Township in Alameda County, California, with their thirteen-year-old daughter and
Mary Sagal’s widowed mother. No occupation was indicated for Mary Sagal. Their
daughter, Bernice, received both a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree from the

University of California, Berkeley, married, and worked as a laboratory technician
before her retirement. She died in 2004.

Mary Helen Sagal taught in the Chowchilla School District for about twenty-ﬁve
years according to the report made by her daughter on the death certiﬁcate. She
died in 1975 as a result of colon cancer at the Eden Hospital in Castro Valley,
California. She was cremated, and her ashes were placed in Irvington Memorial
Cemetery in Fremont. Her husband had died in 1968.
