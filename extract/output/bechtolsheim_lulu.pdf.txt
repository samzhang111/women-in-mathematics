BECHTOLSHEIM, Lulu (Hofmann). May 27, 1902–August 29, 1989.
Realgymnasium der Schillerschule (Frankfurt am Main) (ABITUR 1922), Uni-
versit¨at Z¨urich (PhD 1927).

Lulu Hofmann was the middle daughter of Clara (Olshauson) (1875–1938) and
Otto Hofmann (1863–1956). Her parents were born in Germany, her mother in
Mertsch¨utz and her father in Frankfurt-am-Main. Her mother was the daughter
of a theologian; she attended a Lyzeum, a secondary school for girls, and became
a homemaker after her marriage in 1897. Her father attended a Gymnasium, the
classical German secondary school, and was a stockbroker. Lulu Hofman and her
older sister, Emy (1900–1994), were both born in New York City. Her younger
sister, Ilse, was born in 1910 in Frankfort, Germany. Both sisters attended the same
Gymnasium in Frankfort as Lulu; her older sister also attended an academy of art
in Karlsruhe, and her younger sister studied at universities in Brussels and in Paris;
they later married and became homemakers. Her older sister was also a painter,
and her younger sister was a certiﬁed translator. Her parents were supportive of
their daughters’ higher education.

Hofmann was raised bilingually in German and English and received her com-
plete education in Germany and Switzerland. She attended the Realgymnasium der
Schillerschule in Frankfurt and passed her Abitur, allowing her to attend university,
in 1922. She then attended the Universit¨at Freiburg 1922–23 and the Universit¨at
Z¨urich 1923–26. During 1924–26 she also studied part time at the Eidgen¨ossiche
Technische Hochschule (ETH) in Zurich, where Hermann Weyl held the chair in
mathematics until 1930, when he took the chair at G¨ottingen that was vacated
when Hilbert retired. Starting in 1926, Hofmann assisted Weyl in translating Ger-
man manuscripts into English. Hofmann received her doctorate from the Universit¨at
Z¨urich in 1927 with a dissertation directed by E. G. Togliatti, who was on the fac-
ulty 1924–26. While there she also studied philosophy under Edmund Husserl and
Martin Heidegger. A niece later indicated that Hofmann had described Weyl as
someone with whom she had worked closely, both as a student and afterwards.

Lulu Hofmann returned to the United States in January 1927 and gave an ad-
dress of Springﬁeld, Ohio, when she applied for membership in the AMS that spring.
She was at Columbia University as an assistant in mathematics 1927–28 and as a
lecturer 1928–29; she was an instructor at Barnard College 1929–37. She worked
closely with Edward Kasner of Columbia in that period, assisting him with a paper
that appeared in the Transactions of the AMS in 1928, and doing joint work with
him. Hofmann also continued to assist Weyl, and in a published version of lectures
he delivered at Yale University in 1931 he wrote: “I do not want to omit acknowl-
edging my indebtedness to my friend, Dr. Lulu Hofmann of Columbia University,
. . . for the devoted assistance which she has rendered me in the translation of my
manuscripts into English on this as well as on similar previous occasions” (The
Open World, v). In 1933 Weyl came from G¨ottingen to the Institute for Advanced
Study, and Hofmann continued to help him with English. She later translated his
book Symmetry into German.

In November 1936 Lulu Hofmann married Baron Wilhelm Alfred von Bechtol-
sheim (1881–1968). He was born in Upper Bavaria, the son of the Chamberlain
for the Grand Duke of Luxemburg and later for the King of Bavaria. Baron von
Bechtolsheim had been a Commander in the Imperial German Navy until 1921 and

immigrated to the United States in 1926. He later was a pharmaceutical salesman.
They had no children, although he had children by a previous marriage.

During the summer session of 1937 Lulu von Bechtolsheim was an instructor
at Hunter College. She wrote in 1937 that she was then writing a textbook on
analytic geometry that was diﬀerent from current texts, and that the material
had been used in her classes during the last three terms. That fall she became an
instructor at Queens College where she remained until 1940. She made a trip to
Europe in summer 1938. By 1944 she and her husband had moved to California,
where, during the winter quarter of 1943–44, she was a lecturer in mathematics at
Stanford University. Lulu Bechtolsheim, as she was then known, spent the largest
part of her career at the University of Redlands, east of Los Angeles. She was
assistant professor 1944–50, associate professor 1950–56, and professor 1956–61,
before her retirement in 1961. In addition to her role as a mathematics professor,
she also taught astronomy, Italian, French, and German at Redlands and knew
some Spanish, Portuguese, and Greek. She served, as well, on the honors committee
and committee on comprehensive examinations. She also was an acting assistant
professor of mathematics at Stanford in summer 1947 and attended an institute for
college mathematics teachers at Stanford in summer 1955.

After her retirement, Bechtolsheim continued her scholarly activity, mainly by
engaging in a variety of translations of mathematical manuscripts: by Leopold Nach-
bin from Portuguese into English, by George P´olya from English into German, and
by Bruno de Finetti from Italian into German. The translations into German ap-
peared in the Wissenschaft und Kultur series published by Birkh¨auser Verlag.

Bechtolsheim was interested in poetry. From 1972 she was a member of the An-
throposophical Society, an organization promoting the spiritual philosophy based
on the works of Rudolf Steiner, and from 1981 she belonged to the Christian Com-
munity, inspired by his work as well.

Lulu Bechtolsheim died following an intestinal blockage in 1989 at age eighty-
seven in Redlands, California. She was survived by two step-sons in West Germany
and a sister. Services were held at the Christian Community Church in North
Hollywood, and interment was at Hillside Memorial Park.
