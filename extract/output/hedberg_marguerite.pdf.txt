HEDBERG, Marguerite (Zeigel). August 27, 1907–August 27, 2002.
Delta State Teachers College (BS 1928), University of Missouri (MA 1929,
PhD 1932).

Marguerite Lenore Zeigel was born in Kirksville, Missouri, the second of four
children of Elizabeth (Neef) (1879–1975) and William Henry Zeigel (1875–1947),
natives of Missouri who married in 1900. Her father received a bachelor’s degree in
1900 from Missouri Valley College and a master’s degree in 1904 from the University
of Missouri. From 1917 to 1925 he was a teacher, dean, and head of the mathematics
department at the State Teachers College in Kirksville, Missouri. In 1924 her father
earned a PhD from George Peabody College for Teachers; the following year he
became dean and head of the Department of Education at Delta State Teachers
College (now Delta State University) in Cleveland, Mississippi, where he remained
until 1946. Marguerite Zeigel’s siblings were William (1904–2006), Elizabeth (1910–
2003), and Howard (b. ca. 1920). Her sister, Elizabeth Zeigel Winter, was a professor
and supervisor of student teachers at Delta State Teachers College.

Marguerite Zeigel received her elementary and secondary education in Kirksville,
Missouri. She then attended Delta State Teachers College from 1925 until she re-
ceived her bachelor’s degree in education in 1928, the ﬁrst year bachelor’s degrees
were awarded there. At Delta State she was a member of the college debating team
and at graduation was ranked ﬁrst in her class. The next three years she was a stu-
dent at the University of Missouri. She was a Gregory scholar 1928–29 and received
her master’s degree in 1929. She was a Gregory fellow 1929–31.

Zeigel returned to Delta State as an assistant professor of mathematics and
physics for the year 1931–32. She received her PhD from Missouri in 1932 after
completing her dissertation in geometry with a minor in physics. She then took
a position as assistant professor at a women’s college, Lander College (now the
coeducational Lander University), in Greenwood, South Carolina. The following
year she was promoted to professor.

On August 7, 1936, at the end of her fourth year at Lander, Zeigel married
Ernest Albert Hedberg (1903–1961). Ernest A. Hedberg was born in Huntington,
Missouri, to Swedish parents. His father was a farmer and his mother a housewife.
He received his BS from Northeast Missouri State Teachers College in 1928 and
studied at Stanford University in 1928. He was a graduate student in mathematics
at the University of Missouri during 1929–30, Marguerite Zeigel’s second year there.
He was an instructor at Wentworth Military Academy 1930–32 and received his PhD
from Missouri in 1935. He was a professor at Alabama State Teachers College in
Livingston 1935–36.

The year following their marriage, 1936–37, Ernest Hedberg was professor at
Lander, and Marguerite Z. Hedberg was not on the faculty. The following year he
was professor and acting head of the department at the University of South Dakota.
In 1938 Ernest and Marguerite Hedberg were both hired at Baylor University in
Waco, Texas. On her 1982 Smithsonian questionnaire Marguerite Hedberg described
herself as a teacher in 1938–40 and Ernest Hedberg as an associate professor 1938–
42.

During 1942–43 Marguerite Hedberg returned again to Delta State, this time
as professor and acting head of the department. That year Ernest Hedberg was
an instructor of mathematics, physics, and meteorology at the US Navy Preﬂight

School on the campus of the University of Georgia in Athens. During 1943–44
Marguerite Hedberg was an assistant professor at the University of Georgia while
her husband was teaching in a US Army Specialized Training Program. In 1944 she
worked as a civilian for the US Oﬃce of Scientiﬁc Research and Development while
he was a technical writer in California for a National Defense Research Committee
(NDRC) Project. Ernest Hedberg then served as an associate professor of electrical
communications in the radar school at MIT 1944–46.

In 1946, after the war, they both were hired by the University of South Carolina
in Columbia. Marguerite Hedberg was an adjunct professor 1946–49 and in 1949
became an associate professor; she retired as associate professor emeritus in 1976.
Ernest Hedberg became a professor in 1950; he died in 1961.

Marguerite Hedberg was a member of the education honorary society, Pi Lambda
Theta. She was a Presbyterian and in 1982 reported her hobbies as reading and
listening to good music.

Hedberg was living in Columbia, South Carolina, at the time of her death in 2002
on her ninety-ﬁfth birthday. She was survived by two brothers, a sister, and several
nephews and nieces and was buried in Greenlawn Memorial Park in Columbia. Af-
ter her death, Hedberg’s estate left $1,000,000 for the establishment of the Wyman
Loren Williams and Ernest Albert and Marguerite Zeigel Hedberg Chair of Math-
ematics at the University of South Carolina. Williams was the former head of the
department who recruited the Hedbergs to the university.
