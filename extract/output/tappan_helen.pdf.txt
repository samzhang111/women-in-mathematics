TAPPAN, Helen. October 22, 1888–November 10, 1971.
Western College for Women (BA 1909), Cornell University (MA 1912, PhD
1914).

Anna Helen Tappan was born in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, the ninth of eleven children of
Anna (Grand-Girard), born in 1850, and David Stanton Tappan (1845–1922), natives of
Ohio who married in 1869. Her father earned a bachelor’s degree in 1864 and a master’s
degree in 1866 from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, and graduated from the Western
Theological Seminary in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, in 1867. He was ordained as a Presby-
terian minister and held various academic and pastoral positions before and after serving
as president of Miami University 1899–1902. Tappan Hall there is named for him. Helen
Tappan’s siblings were Benjamin (1871–72), Oella Stanton (1873–1952), Julia May (1875–
1972), Paul Whiting (1877–ca. 1954), David Stanton Jr. (1880–1968), Frank Girard (b.
1882), Lucy Frederica (1884–1900), George Herdman (1886–1950), Edwin Stanton (1890–
1892), and Margaret (1894–1972). Of the seven siblings who survived to adulthood, one
brother became a physician, another became a missionary in China, and her youngest
sister earned a doctorate in education.

In 1905 Helen Tappan graduated from Everts High School in Circleville, Ohio, where
her father was pastor of the Presbyterian Church. She then attended Western College for
Women in Oxford, Ohio; she graduated with honors in 1909 and was an instructor there
for the next two years. In 1911 Tappan enrolled at Cornell University where she was to
remain for the next three years. She received her master’s degree in 1912 with a major in
pure mathematics and a minor in mathematical physics. She was a scholar 1912–13 and
an Erastus Brooks fellow 1913–14 before receiving her PhD in 1914 with work in algebraic
geometry as a student of Virgil Snyder. For her doctorate Tappan presented minors of
mathematical analysis and philosophy.

After receiving her doctorate, Tappan joined the faculty at Iowa State College of Agri-
culture and Mechanic Arts (now Iowa State University of Science and Technology) in
Ames. She remained for eleven years: as instructor 1914–18, assistant professor 1918–22,
and associate professor 1922–25. Others on the mathematics faculty at Iowa State in that
period included Julia T. Colpitts and Fay Farnum.

In 1925 Tappan returned to Western College for Women as professor of mathematics
and head of the department. She also served as dean of women from 1927 until 1941
and as academic dean from 1941 until 1944, when she resigned that position to return
to full-time teaching. She was head of the department at the time of her retirement in
1954 as academic dean emeritus. In 1957–58 she served as acting head of the mathematics
department. When she retired, it was noted that she had spent part of her summers in
southern California with relatives and that she planned to make her home with her sister
and niece in Pasadena.

Western College honored her in 1953 as one of the ten outstanding living alumnae and
again in 1954 with an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree. In 1974 the college
merged with Miami University, which created an interdisciplinary program, the Western
College Program, to continue Western’s then current approach to education. In 1990 the
Western program established a peer learning center called the Anna Helen Tappan Center
for Computer Assisted Learning, whose tutors are called Tappan Tutors. Tappan House,
the third and fourth ﬂoors of Barton Hall at Iowa State University, is also named in her
honor.

In about 1940 Tappan described herself as a Presbyterian and a Republican with in-
terests in reading and dramatics; “her singular ability in dramatics contributed to the
success of one of the ﬁrst faculty plays” at Western College (Nelson, The Western College
for Women, 138). Her travels in Great Britain, Europe, and the United States included a

trip to Europe with friends in the summer of 1928. After her retirement Tappan moved
to South Pasadena, California.

Helen Tappan died in 1971 at age eighty-three at the Westover Retirement Home in
Hamilton, Ohio, after a long illness. A memorial service was held at nearby Western
College where the Helen Tappan Memorial Fund was established.
