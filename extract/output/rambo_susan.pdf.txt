RAMBO, Susan M. April 3, 1883–January 7, 1977.
Smith College (BA 1905, MA 1913), University of Michigan (PhD 1920).

Susan Miller Rambo was born in Easton, Pennsylvania, the eldest of ﬁve children
of Annie Roberta (Kortz) (b. 1852) and George Green Rambo (b. 1842). Her mother
was from Easton, in eastern Pennsylvania. Her father, who was born in New Jersey,
was a wholesale grocer in Easton after his marriage to Annie Kortz in about 1880.
The other children were Ella K. (b. 1884), George D. (1886–1945), Isabel K. (1887–
1974)), and Annie R. (b. 1890).

Susan Rambo attended high school in her home town of Easton before entering
Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. She graduated from Smith in 1905
and taught mathematics in the high school in Hoosick Falls, New York, near the
Massachusetts border for two of the years between 1905 and 1908.

In the fall of 1908, Susan Rambo and Pauline Sperry, who had earned a BA
in 1906 and an MA in 1908 from Smith, were hired as assistants in mathematics
at Smith College, in part, presumably, since Ruth G. Wood was on leave to study
at G¨ottingen for the year. Except for leaves of absence, Rambo remained in the
department at Smith the remainder of her career: as assistant 1908–11, instructor
1911–18, assistant professor 1918–22, associate professor 1922–37, professor 1937–
48, and professor emeritus after her retirement in 1948.

In addition to her teaching, Rambo also took graduate courses in her early years
at Smith. She had courses in mathematics (Projective Geometry, Theory of Func-
tions, Descriptive Geometry, and History of Mathematics) and in astronomy (Ana-
lytical Mechanics, Transit Instrument, Equatorial Telescope, Computing, and His-
tory of Astronomy) and received a master’s degree from Smith in 1913. References
in her master’s thesis also include lectures by C. J. Keyser at Columbia University
in 1907 and by G. A. Bliss at the University of Chicago in 1910.

In 1916, having taken a leave of absence for the year 1916–17, Rambo entered
the University of Michigan. Her Smith colleague and friend, Suzan Benedict, had
received her PhD two years earlier from Michigan. Rambo was in residence at
Michigan for two years and received her degree in 1920, two years after returning
to her position at Smith.

Rambo’s many contributions at Smith include introducing a statistics course in
her ﬁrst decade there and serving as department chairman from 1934 to 1940. She
attended the International Congress of Mathematicians in Bologna in 1928. Rambo
was also a member of the Connecticut Valley Section of the Association of Teachers
of Mathematics in New England and of the Round Hill Club, a paper reading club
in Springﬁeld. She took a leave of absence the second semester 1937–38 during
which she made a trip around the world.

In the Smith College Twenty-Fifth Reunion Class Book in 1930 it was noted
that Susan Rambo “drives a Ford, gardens, and keeps a charming home with a
friend.” She shared a house with Suzan Benedict at one site from 1918 to 1924 and
at a second from 1924 until Benedict’s death in 1942. Their home was typically the
location for the department Christmas party. In 1945 Rambo relinquished her life
tenure on the house, and it went to Smith to be sold and the proceeds to be used
for scholarships.

Rambo died in a Northampton nursing home in 1977 and was survived by a
niece and three nephews; at least two other nephews had been killed in World War

II. In an obituary notice Neal McCoy, a Smith colleague, observed that she had
been “impatient with stupidity and appalled by indolence,” had had a “lifelong
passion for ﬂowers,” and was a “kind and generous lady.” She was buried in Eas-
ton, Pennsylvania. The Susan M. Rambo Fund that provides support for summer
student research in mathematics at Smith was established in her memory by a 1931
graduate of Smith.
