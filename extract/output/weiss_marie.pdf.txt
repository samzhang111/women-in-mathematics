WEISS, Marie J. September 21, 1903–August 19, 1952.
Stanford University (BA 1925, PhD 1928), Radcliffe College (MA 1926).

Marie Johanna Weiss was born in Eugene, California, the youngest of three surviving
children of Alice Hedwig (Buschke) and Frederick Weiss. Both parents were born in Ger-
many, her mother in 1880 and her father in 1869; they immigrated to the United States in
1894 and 1884, respectively. At the turn of the century, they had been married three years,
had a one-year-old daughter, and were living in Stanislaus County, California, where Fred-
erick Weiss raised stock. By 1910 the family, with children Hedwig age eleven, Karl age
nine, and Marie, owned their own farm and were living in Stockton, where they remained
throughout Marie’s university years.

Marie J. Weiss attended public grammar and high schools in Stockton, California,
before going to Stanford University in the fall of 1921. While there she was a member of
Roble Club, which was the women’s dormitory; the German Club, of which she was vice
president for two years; the Women’s Education Club, of which she was secretary-treasurer
her senior year; and the Zoology Club. In the summer of 1924, after her junior year, she
served as an assistant in instruction in mathematics. She was elected to Phi Beta Kappa
and graduated with great distinction in mathematics in 1925, one of eleven receiving BA’s
in mathematics at Stanford that year, eight of whom were women.

The following academic year Weiss studied at Radcliﬀe College, where she earned her
master’s degree, before returning to Stanford as a graduate student and university fellow
in mathematics during the two years 1926–28. She was again an assistant in instruction
and taught theory of functions in the summer of 1927. Her dissertation in group theory,
directed by W. A. Manning, is dated August 1927. She received her PhD in June 1928. A
published version of her dissertation appeared in 1928 and was mentioned in E. T. Bell’s
1938 survey, “Fifty years of algebra in America, 1888–1938.” It was one of very few papers
chosen to “indicate the continued activity of men already in the ﬁeld in 1907, the enlisting
of new recruits, and the general nature of the problems considered” by those working in
group theory (p. 13). Weiss was appointed to a National Research Council fellowship in
mathematics for 1928–29 and was reappointed for the following year; she spent both years
studying at the University of Chicago.

In 1930 the mathematics department at H. Sophie Newcomb College, Tulane University,
underwent signiﬁcant changes: Marie J. Weiss joined the faculty as assistant professor, Nola
Anderson (Haynes) joined the department as associate professor and chair, and Anna M.
Howe left Newcomb after eleven years as assistant professor. Weiss remained at Newcomb
as assistant professor until 1936, except for 1934–35, when she was on leave to spend the
year at Bryn Mawr College as Emmy Noether scholar and resident scholar in mathematics.
Weiss was one of four graduate students and post-graduates (the others were Ruth Stauﬀer
(McKee), Grace Shover (Quinn), and Olga Taussky) invited to study with Emmy Noether
in her second year at Bryn Mawr and what turned out to be the last year of Noether’s
life. It was during this year that Weiss began work on a problem on units in ﬁelds that
resulted in her 1936 paper.

Weiss returned to Newcomb College for the year 1935–36 but left in 1936 to take an
assistant professorship at Vassar College. After two years at Vassar she returned to New-
comb as professor and chair when, in 1938, Nola Anderson left the Newcomb department
to marry. Weiss remained in those positions the rest of her career there. She turned her
attention to preparing a highly successful text and to participating in many professional
activities in addition to administering the department and teaching at Newcomb. She was
particularly active as a member of the MAA. She attended annual meetings regularly after
receiving her PhD and was a member of the board of trustees 1937–38. She refereed papers
for the Monthly from at least 1939 until 1946 and was associate editor 1940–46. In that role
she was also editor of the Discussion and Notes section 1943–46. She was a member of the

Committee to Review Activities of the MAA 1938–40; was a member of the Conference
Committee on Education 1941–44; and was governor-at-large 1950–52. Although not as
active in the governance of the AMS, she presented six papers at meetings 1927–36, was
appointed to the nominating committee in 1939, and gave a brief dinner talk at a meeting
in Chicago the following year. Weiss was also active at the national level in AAUP, serving
on the council 1940–42 and as second vice president 1948–50.

In an undated interview in her ﬁle in the Tulane archives, Weiss remarked on mathe-
matics as a ﬁeld for women. She noted that in the previous year eight women had received
doctorates in mathematics in the US and Canada. She said, “Mathematics is an open
ﬁeld for women but few of the top positions–either in teaching or research–are held by
women. . . . For the woman who desires a chance for a top position in either teaching or
research, the doctorate is a union card. And top positions in either teaching or research
form what is essentially a ‘closed shop.’ ”

Beginning in about February 1952 Marie Weiss became increasingly ill. While visiting
her widowed mother and her brother in Visalia, California, in the summer of 1952 the
illness worsened, and, after six days in the Langley Porter Clinic in San Francisco, Marie
Weiss died, at age forty-eight, of congestive heart failure as a result of bacterial endocardi-
tis. Weiss had been a Lutheran and is buried in Stockton, California. The Marie J. Weiss
Memorial Scholarship Fund was established at Newcomb College in 1952.
