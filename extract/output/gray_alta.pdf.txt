GRAY, Alta (Odoms). October 1, 1910–December 30, 2001.
University of Cincinnati (BA 1931, MA 1932, PhD 1936).

Alta Harriet Odoms was born in Fredonia, Indiana, the third of four children
of Ethel (Nelson) (ca. 1878–1962) and John Bert Odoms (b. ca. 1872). Both her
parents were natives of Ohio. She had two older sisters, Berta (b. ca. 1904) and
Lulu (1909–2005), and a younger brother, Howard (1918–1995). In 1910 her father
was a farmer in Crawford County, Ohio; in the 1920s and 1930s he was a plasterer,
and the family was living in Clermont county, east of Cincinnati, Ohio.

After Alta Odoms graduated from high school in Milford, Ohio, all of her college
education was completed at the nearby University of Cincinnati. As an undergrad-
uate she was a member of the University of Cincinnati mathematics club before
receiving her BA in 1931; she served as treasurer while a graduate student in fall
1932. Immediately after her graduation, Odoms continued her graduate work at the
University of Cincinnati and received her master’s degree in 1932 and her PhD in
1936. Essential parts of her dissertation appeared in an article that she coauthored
with H. L. Miller. Miller, a 1931 student of Odom’s advisor C. N. Moore, was then
on the faculty of the College of Engineering and Commerce at Cincinnati.

From 1935 through March 1937, Odoms was in New York working as an editorial
assistant for the American Mathematical Society after Caroline Seely’s resignation
as clerk; she was succeeded by Mildred M. Sullivan. While in New York, she regu-
larly attended meetings of the AMS there. She also auditioned for and was selected
to sing with the New York City Oratorio Society. She resigned from the AMS job
after two years and looked for a teaching position. She wrote to one of the authors
in 1992 that Duke oﬀered her part-time teaching in the Woman’s College if she
would work for the Duke Mathematical Journal, which had begun two years earlier
in 1935. Apparently the teaching part of the job just lasted for a year, after which
she worked as secretary for the journal.

On December 10, 1938, Alta Odoms married William Frederick Gray. Gray, born
in Charleston, South Carolina, in about 1913, and Odoms met in Durham, North
Carolina. Interested in a career in government and foreign service, William Gray
entered the Fletcher School, the oldest exclusively graduate school of international
aﬀairs in the United States, in Medford, Massachusetts, in 1941. This move caused
Alta Gray to resign from her position at the Duke Mathematical Journal, but she
found work in 1941–42 as secretary of the radiation laboratory at MIT. She de-
scribed herself as “useful as jack-of-all-trades” in the 1992 letter. The Grays had a
son and two daughters.

The Grays went to Washington, D.C., in 1942, where William Gray worked for
the Board of Economic Warfare. Alta Gray “spent the next ten years producing and
enjoying three children,” according to her 1992 letter. In 1952 William Gray joined
the State Department Foreign Service and served in countries in Europe and Latin
America. Between assignments and after Gray’s retirement in 1964, they lived in
the Washington, D.C., area.

Alta Gray was interested in politics, history, and nineteenth-century literature.
She wrote in 1992, “I have had a wonderful life. . . . Forgive me for having packed
away all those mathematics books long years ago.”

William Gray died in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1986. Alta Gray continued to
live in Charlottesville and was a long-time resident there of Branchlands Retirement

Village. In December 2001, during a holiday visit to a daughter in the Richmond,
Virginia, area, she became ill and died at age ninety-one at the Bon Secours Memo-
rial Regional Medical Center in Mechanicsville, Virginia. Gray was survived by her
three children, William F. Jr., Ellen, and Barbara; four grandchildren; and a sister.
She was buried in the Gray family plot in Magnolia Cemetery, Charleston, South
Carolina.
