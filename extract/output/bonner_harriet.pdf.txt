BONNER, Harriet (Rees). July 16, 1914–June 28, 1978.
Rockford College (BA 1934), University of Chicago (MS 1935, PhD 1937).

Harriet Rees was born in Mt. Morris, Illinois, the daughter of Wilhelmina (Mina)
Marie (Middour) (1883–1955), of Illinois, and Vernon Victor Rees (1882–1956), a
native of Iowa, who married in about 1911. Her only sibling, a brother, died as an
infant. She grew up on a farm near Mt. Morris, where her father was farming in
1920. In 1930 her father worked in the bindery of a printing plant.

Rees received her elementary and secondary education in the public schools of
Mt. Morris and attended nearby Rockford College from 1930 to 1934. At Rockford
she was a member of the classical club, the Socratic honor society, and the orchestra.
She received a BA with honors in mathematics and a diploma in piano in 1934.
She began her graduate work at the University of Chicago in October of 1934 and
continued her work there until June 1937 when she received her doctorate. She
was a Talcott fellow from Rockford College 1934–35. At Chicago she studied under
Mayme Irwin Logsdon, among others, and wrote her master’s thesis in number
theory under Leonard Eugene Dickson and her PhD dissertation in a related area
in abstract algebra under A. Adrian Albert.

Rees was appointed instructor of mathematics at the University of Utah in 1937
and remained there a year and a half before resigning in December 1938. While
there she was a member of Sigma Delta Epsilon for graduate women in science. She
was married on January 1, 1939, to James Fredrick Bonner (1910–1996), the son of
the chairman of the chemistry department at Utah. Bonner had received his PhD
from the California Institute of Technology in 1934 and became a distinguished
molecular biologist. He was on the faculty at Caltech from 1935 until 1981 and was
elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences. The Bonners were divorced
in 1966, and James Bonner remarried the following year.

The Bonners had two children, both born in Los Angeles: a daughter, Joey, born
June 10, 1948, and a son James Jos´e, born May 1, 1950. Both children later earned
PhD’s, Joey in Chinese intellectual history from Harvard, and J. Jos´e in biology
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Before their children were born the
Bonners were serious climbers. In October 1947 they were awarded emblem status
by the Desert Peaks Section of the Sierra Club for having climbed ﬁfteen peaks,
including ﬁve of the seven designated emblem peaks.

During the 1940s and 1950s Harriet Bonner worked with her husband and his
colleagues and received thanks for her mathematical analyses in several publications
in biology. She coauthored one paper with James Bonner and another with A. J.
Haagen-Smit, an authority on air pollution, who was later elected a member of the
National Academy of Sciences.

Harriet Bonner taught mathematics at the continuation high school in Pasadena
from 1968 until 1975. She was also an excellent pianist and studied piano and
voice at Pasadena City College. She developed symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease
and was eventually moved to San Francisco, where she died in 1978, shortly before
her sixty-fourth birthday.
Organizational aﬃliations: AMS, Sigma Xi.
