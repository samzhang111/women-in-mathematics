PRICE, Irene. January 16, 1902–March 13, 1999.
Indiana University (BA 1926, MA 1927, PhD 1932).

Irene Price was born in Parr, Indiana, the second of ﬁve children of Ruth Eliza-
beth (Schroer) (1875–1954), originally of Zanesville, Ohio, and William Edward
Price (1874–1930), born near Rensselaer, Indiana. Her mother attended school
through the eighth grade and her father through about the sixth grade. Her par-
ents, who married September 24, 1899, farmed in northwestern Indiana. Her older
sister, Lilly (1900–1932), ﬁnished high school and taught for four years before her
marriage. Her next younger sister, Gladys (1903–1976), completed a master’s de-
gree and was a biology teacher in Macon, Georgia, until her marriage. Her brother,
Lawson (1908–1984), was an electrical engineer and then a farmer before his retire-
ment, while her youngest sister, Esther (1912–2006), ﬁnished high school, married,
and was a beautician.

Irene Price attended high school in Rensselaer, Indiana, 1915–19 before teaching
grade school in Rensselaer for the next four years. During the summer of 1921 she
studied at Indiana State Normal School (now Indiana State University) in Terre
Haute.

Price recalled many years later that she entered Indiana University thinking she
knew what she wanted to do. “Mathematics was always my favorite subject and
I just intended that eventually teaching high school was my goal, but when I got
in college I had some very good professors who encouraged me to go on and get
a doctorate” (Smithsonian meeting tapes 1981). She completed the work for her
bachelor’s degree at Indiana in 1926 and stayed there the next three years for her
graduate work in mathematics. She was a part-time instructor at Indiana 1926–29,
was awarded a Clara Javen Goodbody scholarship in 1927, and was an instructor
in the extension division 1927–29. She earned her master’s degree in 1927, and an
article with the same title as that of her master’s thesis appeared in the American
Mathematical Monthly the following year. While at Indiana she also worked on a
tables computation project directed by Harold T. Davis, which was published as
a two-volume work in 1933 and 1935. Price’s doctorate was granted by Indiana
in 1932. At Indiana she was a member of Pi Lambda Theta and Kappa Delta Pi,
education honor societies; Sigma Xi; and Phi Beta Sigma, a service fraternity.

After her graduate studies, Price had three somewhat distinct careers. She was
a college professor for about ﬁfteen years, then worked as a statistician for the US
Air Force for a dozen years, and ﬁnally was self-employed as a real estate agent
for more than forty years. From 1929 to 1944 she was professor of mathematics
at Oshkosh Teachers College (now University of Wisconsin Oshkosh). She went to
Oshkosh the year after the arrival of May Beenken, the department head. While
there Price taught the full range of mathematics courses oﬀered by the college. In
addition to maintaining memberships in various professional associations, she was
active in the Wisconsin Section of the MAA and served on the program committee
1934–35 and 1939–40 and as chairman of the section 1941–42. She also belonged to
the Oshkosh Education Association, for which she served as treasurer for several
years after 1936, and the AAUW, for which she was president of the Oshkosh branch
1942–43.

In 1944 Price began her employment as a statistician for the Headquarters of
the Air Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. While

in Ohio she coauthored a technical report and taught several evening courses in
college mathematics in Dayton and at Miami University in nearby Oxford. Price
remained in Ohio until 1949, when she moved to Alamogordo, New Mexico, where
she directed mathematical research on guided missiles at the Holloman Air Force
Base until 1953. She then took a position as a mathematician at White Sands
Proving Ground where she stayed until 1956. While in these positions she authored,
sometimes jointly, technical reports about data reduction. These reports dealt with
the recording of measurements made by sophisticated instruments such as miniature
infrared analyzers (MIRAN) and ﬁring error indicators (FEI). According to her
obituary, “she was charged with developing mathematical theories of tracking the
speed, path, and trajectory of missiles being tested at White Sands Missile Range.”
She also gave talks about this and related work in the early 1950s at conferences
held at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Holloman Air Force Base, and White
Sands Proving Ground.

In 1956 Irene Price became owner of Price Realty and after 1956 was engaged in
a number of professional activities associated with this business. She held various
oﬃces in the Alamogordo Board of Realtors, was district director of the New Mexico
Realtors Association 1962–64, and was a member of the National Association of
Realtors. In 1971 she taught a college course in real estate practice to retiring
military at Holloman Air Force Base, and in 1978 she was named Alamogordo
Realtor of the Year by the Alamogordo Board of Realtors. She retired from the real
estate business in January 1998 at ninety-six.

In about 1940 Price described her hobbies as going on picnics and gardening.
In 1981 Price reported other interests; she wrote that she was aﬃliated with the
Christian Church and was a member of the John Birch Society, Business and Pro-
fessional Women (treasurer 1957), the Republican Women’s Club 1963–65, Women
Aware, and the Alamogordo Chamber of Commerce. She was also a trustee of the
Betty Dare Foundation and a member of the advisory board of the Betty Dare
Good Samaritan Center, a nursing home.

Irene Price was ninety-seven when she died at the Aristocrat Assisted Living
Center in Alamogordo, New Mexico, in 1999. She was cremated and a memorial
service was celebrated at a Christian Church in Alamogordo. She was survived by
a sister, a cousin, and nieces and nephews.
