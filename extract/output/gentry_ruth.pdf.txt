GENTRY, Ruth. February 22, 1862–October 18, 1917.
University of Michigan (PhB 1890), Bryn Mawr College (PhD 1894).

Ruth Ellen Gentry was born in Stilesville, Indiana, the daughter of Lucre-
tia (1830–1909), born in Indiana, and Jeremiah Gentry (1827–1906), from Ken-
tucky. Her father was a farmer and stock trader, and later dry goods merchant, in
Stilesville, southwest of Indianapolis. She had at least two older siblings: a brother,
Oliver (1853–1878), and a sister, Sarah F. (b. ca 1855).

Ruth Gentry attended the public schools of Stilesville. According to the Gentry
family genealogy, she began teaching school at age sixteen and later used her savings
to pay her way through college. She graduated from the Indiana State Normal
School in Terre Haute in 1880 and “spent the next ten years in preparatory and
college teaching, and in study in the University of Michigan” (PhD dissertation
“Life”). She was formally admitted to the University of Michigan in October 1885.
In a history of women at Michigan, a fellow student is quoted as describing the
atmosphere for women taking mathematics classes with engineering students: “Ruth
Gentry and I were the only girls in a large class of engineers. We had front seats and
left the room ﬁrst. I never did see the faces of those young men in class” (Bordin,
19). Before completing her undergraduate work she taught for two years. In 1886–
88, she was Preceptress and Teacher of Mathematics and Mathematical Sciences
in Deland, Florida. The school was called DeLand Academy and College her ﬁrst
year, and college preparatory classes were the highest level taught. Her second year
there the school was called Deland University, and three students were enrolled in
the college department. It became John B. Stetson University a year later. Gentry
graduated from the University of Michigan with the PhB degree in 1890.

That fall Ruth Gentry began her graduate studies at Bryn Mawr College and held
the fellowship in mathematics 1890–91. She was awarded the European Fellowship
of the Association of Collegiate Alumnae for the year 1891–92. She ﬁrst went to
Berlin, where she knew people. She described her situation in a June 1892 article
as follows:

In America, I had heard that a woman was occasionally permit-
ted, as an exceptional favor, to become a a sort of supposed-to-be-
invisible guest in lectures in some universities of Germany; that in
Berlin, however, all eﬀort to secure such exceptional privilege would
be utterly useless. . . . I made inquiries of various prominent Profes-
sors of Mathematics elsewhere than in Berlin; result, a collection of
letters now treasured as souvenirs, no show of hope for me except
in Leipzig, where the work in Mathematics was not exactly suited
to my purpose, and a state of mind well adapted to lead to suicide.
Having nursed my despair till the University [of Berlin] had of-
ﬁcially opened, I concluded to seek a long-desired interview with
Prof. Fuchs and “view the prospect o’er” for myself. Prof. Fuchs
did not politely “thank me for the honor, etc., while regretting to
be unable to admit a woman to his lectures;” he did not assure
me Mathematics was a diﬃcult subject which women, for the most
part, could not comprehend (as one Professor had written); he did
not, as the Rector of one University did, advise me to apply to the
Ministerium, and accompany his advice with the assurance that

my request would not be granted; he did not make me feel that a
woman possessed of an interest in Mathematics was a sort of natural
curiosity, whose existence demanded explanation. He asked me in
his quiet, restful way, what I had done in Mathematics and under
whose instruction, talked a minute or two about Briot and Bou-
quet’s Fonctions Elliptiques, and told me to ask the Rector of the
University whether a way could not be found to favor my petition.
(1892, 45–46)

With the backing of Professor Lazarus Immanuel Fuchs, Rector F¨orster approved
her request as long as the lecturers did not object. A month later that approval was
revoked when it was discovered that in 1884, despite approval of a similar request by
the University Senate, “the Ministerium had strictly, speciﬁcally forbidden” such
arrangements (1892, 46). Nonetheless, the Rector allowed her to continue attending
the lectures of Fuchs and Dr. Ludwig Schlesinger until the end of the semester. She
remained in Europe through the ﬁrst semester of 1892–93 and attended lectures by
Professors ´Emile Picard, Gaston Darboux, and Louis Raﬀy at the Sorbonne, before
returning to the United States in February 1893.

James C. Albisetti claims that Gentry may have had more impact on the admis-
sion of women to German universities than any other American woman. Although
she studied one semester at Berlin, Albisetti claims that she applied ﬁrst to the
University of Heidelberg and was turned down on October 20, 1891. Just nine
days later, however, “inﬂuenced by her application and that of Marie Gernet from
Karlsruhe, ﬁve members of the mathematics-sciences faculty proposed that women
should be allowed to study at Heidelberg with any professors who would have them.
The university senate rejected this idea but was overridden by Baden’s Ministry of
Education, which . . . gave them permission to audit courses in the mathematics-
sciences faculty” (Albisetti, 225).

Gentry again held the fellowship in mathematics at Bryn Mawr in 1892–93 and
was a fellow by courtesy there in 1893–94. In February 1894 she was elected to
membership in the New York Mathematical Society, which became the American
Mathematical Society a few months later. Gentry passed her examinations for the
PhD degree in June 1894. In 1895 she was made a member of the academic council at
Bryn Mawr College. Her dissertation, which appeared in printed form in 1896, was
written under the direction of Charlotte A. Scott, whom she acknowledged by noting
that, “I ﬁnd it hard adequately to express my indebtedness and my gratitude for
the inspiration derived from her unfailing interest in my work.” Gentry was Scott’s
ﬁrst PhD student; however, because of the delay in the printing of her dissertation,
she is often listed as sharing that honor with Isabel Maddison who received her
degree in 1896.

Gentry began teaching at Vassar College in 1894. She was instructor 1894–1900
and associate professor 1900–02. In her earliest years there, she taught courses
in solid and spherical geometry, plane trigonometry, determinants and theory of
equations, curve tracing, analytic geometry of three dimensions, modern methods
in analytic geometry, and analytic mechanics, among possibly others. In 1901–02
she played cornet in the Vassar symphony orchestra.

She left Vassar in 1902 and took a position as associate principal and head teacher
of mathematics at Miss Gleim’s School for Girls, a private school in Pittsburgh,
where she remained until 1905. In December 1905, Gentry reported to the Michigan

alumni oﬃce that her address was Stilesville, and in December 1909 and October
1910, she reported an Indianapolis address. In 1910 she also gave her occupation
as unsalaried nursing. A later note indicated that she was doing charity work in
Stilesville. From 1911 to 1914, she travelled in the United States and Europe and
arrived back in the United States from Europe in February 1914. In August 1916,
she reported that she was living in Indianapolis.

A vita published in 1929 by the AAUW reports that “Dr. Gentry was increasingly
ill from the time she left Vassar until her death” (Maltby, 13). Obituaries indicate
that she came from the East three weeks before her death to enter the Methodist
Hospital in Indianapolis, where she died at age ﬁfty-ﬁve in October 1917. The
death certiﬁcate gives the cause of death as “Acute Melancholia” with contributor
“Mental Status following Operation for Cancer of Breast.” Ruth Gentry was buried
in the family plot in Stilesville.
