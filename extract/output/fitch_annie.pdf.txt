FITCH, Annie (MacKinnon). June 1, 1868–September 12, 1940.
University of Kansas (BS 1889, MS 1891), Cornell University (PhD 1894).

Annie Louise MacKinnon was born in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada, the daugh-
ter of Annie Louise (Gilbert) (1834–ca. 1919), and Malcolm MacKinnon (1838–ca.
1903), natives of Ontario. The family was living in Kansas by 1870, and according
to census records from 1870 and 1880, there were at least ﬁve children. They were
Gilbert J., age ﬁve in 1870 but not listed in the 1880 census; Annie; Malcolm, an
infant in 1870 and ten in 1880; Frederick B., age eight in 1880; and D. Stanley,
age one in 1880. In 1870 her father was a real estate agent, and in 1880 he was
a hardware merchant. She lived in Concordia, Kansas, during her childhood and
graduated from Concordia High School.

MacKinnon then enrolled at the University of Kansas in Lawrence and was
one of the ﬁrst two women in our study to graduate from a public university.
The University of Kansas opened in 1866 with about ﬁfty students, roughly half
men and half women, although the ﬁrst degree was not awarded until 1873. It
appears that after her graduation in 1889, MacKinnon began her graduate work in
mathematics at Kansas. According to Price’s history of the Kansas mathematics
department, she was the third graduate student in mathematics in the university’s
history. MacKinnon also taught in the high school in Lawrence 1890–92 and received
her master’s degree in 1891. In 1891–92, she continued her studies at the University
of Kansas with Henry Byron Newson, a research mathematician who had been
appointed to the faculty a year earlier.

MacKinnon enrolled at Cornell University in October 1892 and was Erastus
Brooks fellow her last year there, 1893–94. It was noted that she had previously
completed non-resident graduate work in modern geometry. She received her PhD
from Cornell in 1894 with major subject theory of functions, ﬁrst minor quantics
and statics, and second minor mathematical physics.

Annie MacKinnon spent the next two years studying mathematics at G¨ottingen,
as Association of Collegiate Alumnae European fellow in 1894–95 and as Women’s
Education Association of Boston European fellow in 1895–96. Also at G¨ottingen
during this period were Mary Frances Winston, later to marry Henry Byron New-
son; John H. Tanner, an assistant professor of mathematics from Cornell; and Ed-
ward Fitch, an assistant professor of Greek at Hamilton College whom MacKinnon
later married.

After returning from G¨ottingen in 1896, MacKinnon was appointed the professor
of mathematics at Wells College, a small college for women in Aurora, New York,
that awarded its ﬁrst degree in 1869. In addition to being the only mathemat-
ics instructor, teaching courses through diﬀerential equations, she was registrar in
1900–01. She remained at Wells until 1901, when on July 3, in Lakeside, Ohio, she
married Edward Fitch (1864–1946). MacKinnon’s replacement at Wells was Anna
Lavinia Van Benschoten, who would subsequently earn her doctorate from Cornell.
Edward Fitch was born in Alton, New York, and received his BA in 1886 and his
MA in 1889 in Greek from Hamilton College, a school for men in Clinton, New York.
He went to G¨ottingen in 1893 and studied under the eminent classical philologist
Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorﬀ. Fitch received his PhD in 1896, Wilamowitz’s
only American doctoral student. Like MacKinnon, Fitch returned that year from
G¨ottingen to New York State. He resumed his position teaching Greek at Hamilton

College, which was nearly a hundred miles from Wells College. Edward Fitch spent
the rest of his career at Hamilton, where he was promoted to associate professor in
1899 and was named Edward North Professor of Greek in 1904. He was dean 1926–
32 and spent the following year as a professor at the American School of Classical
Studies at Athens. He retired in 1934 as professor and dean emeritus. They had no
children.

Annie Fitch was a member of the League of Women Voters and was on the
book committee of a nearby town library. In the late 1920s, she reported to the
AAUW that “after [her] marriage [she] continued upon mathematical investigations
started some years before” (Maltby, 16). She was a charter member of the MAA
and maintained that membership until her death at age seventy-two. She died at
her home in Clinton, New York, after a long illness, having written to Helen Owens
in May 1940, a few months before her death: “It seems to me worthwhile that some
women are intelligent about things mathematical even if their own accomplishments
are not great” (Owens Papers).
Organizational aﬃliations: AMS, MAA (charter member), AAAS, Phi Beta Kappa,
