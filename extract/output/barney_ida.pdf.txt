BARNEY, Ida. November 6, 1886–March 7, 1982.
Smith College (BA 1908), Yale University (PhD 1911).

Ida Barney was born in New Haven, Connecticut, the ﬁrst of two daughters
of Ida (Bushnell) (1858–1941) and Samuel Eben Barney (1859–1940), natives of
Connecticut who married in 1884. Her father was born in New Haven, graduated
from the Sheﬃeld Scientiﬁc School of Yale University in 1879, served as a consultant
on various engineering projects, and was on the civil engineering faculty at Yale
from 1882 until his retirement in 1924. Her sister, Elizabeth Hunt (1894–1958),
graduated from Smith College in 1914 and was secretary to the dean, and later to
the registrar, of the Yale Divinity School.

Ida Barney attended New Haven High School 1900–04, Smith College 1904–08,
and Yale Graduate School 1908–11. She was a mathematics major at Smith, where
her studies included a course in general astronomy and one in the theory and use
of transit instruments in addition to various ones in geometry, calculus, theory of
equations, history of mathematics, and real and complex variables. Her courses
at Yale included, among others, advanced theory of functions, elliptic functions,
Abelian functions, and abstract thermodynamics, all from James Pierpont, who
also directed her dissertation. She received her PhD from Yale in 1911.

After Barney ﬁnished her graduate work, she spent the next ten years on various
mathematics faculties, starting as professor of mathematics at Rollins College in
Winter Park, Florida, 1911–12. She was at Smith College for six years: as an assis-
tant 1912–13, as instructor 1913–17, and as assistant professor 1920–21. Between
her two periods of time at Smith, she was professor ﬁrst at Lake Erie College in
Painesville, Ohio, 1917–19, and then at Meredith College in Raleigh, North Car-
olina, 1919–20, where she was the only member of the department. All but Rollins
College were women’s colleges at the time.

Barney spent the rest of her life in or around New Haven, where she and her
sister lived with their parents until their parents’ deaths in the early 1940s. After
that Ida Barney and her sister lived in the family home until her sister’s death in
1958.

In 1921 Barney enrolled in a graduate course in astronomy at Yale, and the
following year she was appointed research assistant at the Yale Observatory. She
took additional graduate courses in astronomy in 1922 and 1928. Early in her tenure
at the observatory she became involved in a major star mapping project under
the direction of Frank Schlesinger. This project, cataloguing positions and proper
motions of stars, was done with the participation of the Lick Observatory of the
University of California, the US Naval Observatory, and the Royal Observatories at
Greenwich and the Cape of Good Hope. Barney was coauthor with Schlesinger, and
sometimes others, of twelve volumes of catalogues that appeared in the Transactions
of the Astronomical Observatory of Yale University. The ﬁrst six of these volumes,
appearing 1925 though 1934, were produced before IBM punch-card machines were
used to facilitate computations.

After Frank Schlesinger’s retirement in 1941, Barney was named director of the
project. Between 1945 and 1950 she authored another eight volumes of catalogues.
In 1949 she was promoted to research associate in astronomy, with the rank of
associate professor, for a ﬁve-year term. When the project was completed in 1950
it resulted in what is known as the Yale Photographic Zone catalogues. In 1951

through 1954 Barney authored a supplementary volume and two revised catalogues.
She also coauthored three new catalogues, one in 1954 and two in 1959, four years
after her retirement.

Barney was recognized by her colleagues for her achievements. In 1945 the Amer-
ican Astronomical Society created a council, and the following year Barney was
elected to a three-year term on it. She was a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Soci-
ety of London. In 1952 Barney was awarded the Annie J. Cannon Prize, established
in 1934 and given no more often than every three years, by the American Astronom-
ical Society. According to an item in the April 1953 issue of the Publications of the
Astronomical Society of the Paciﬁc, “Miss Barney was cited for her work on the . . .
Yale Photographic Zone Catalogue, which required a half-million measurements and
twenty-three years of computation work before it was completed in 1950” (65:99).
A letter to the editor of Sky and Telescope after Barney’s death in 1982 quoted Dirk
Brouwer, director of the Yale Observatory 1941–66, concerning her receipt of the
prize: “It seems especially ﬁtting that the prize named for a woman who classiﬁed
a half-million spectra should be given to one who made approximately the same
number of measures for the positions and motions of stars.”

Ida Barney continued to live in the family house in New Haven for several years.
She had no immediate survivors at the time of her death in an assisted living facility
in Hamden, Connecticut, just outside New Haven, at age ninety-ﬁve in 1982. She
is buried in the family plot in the Grove Street Cemetery in New Haven.
