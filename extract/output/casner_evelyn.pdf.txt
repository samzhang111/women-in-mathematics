CASNER, Evelyn (Wiggin). March 1, 1900–November 5, 1964.
Wellesley College (BA 1921), Brown University (MA 1924), University of
Chicago (PhD 1936).

Evelyn Prescott Wiggin was born in Stratham, New Hampshire, the elder of
two daughters of New Hampshire natives Margaret Prescott (Green) (1871–1905)
and George Herbert Wiggin (1864–1948), a farmer. Her parents, neither of whom
had attended college, married on December 30, 1896, and her mother died three
days after giving birth to their second daughter, Elsie [or Elise] Green Wiggin, in
September 1905. Her father remarried in 1908.

Evelyn Wiggin received her early education at Robinson Seminary, a public
secondary school in Exeter, New Hampshire, before entering Wellesley College in
1917. While at Wellesley she was a Durant scholar. After her graduation as a
mathematics major in 1921, she taught mathematics at the high school in Massena,
New York, during 1921–22.

On March 28, 1922, Wiggin received a letter from R. G. D. Richardson at Brown
University, who, at the suggestion of “my good friends, Misses [Helen A.] Merrill
and [Clara E.] Smith at Wellesley,” invited her to apply for a position as a graduate
assistant in the department at Brown University (Correspondence 1921–1925, R. G.
D. Richardson Papers, Brown University Archives). He wanted someone to assist
him half time and indicated that there was also the opportunity to study toward
the MA degree. He noted that there were usually four or ﬁve students studying
for master’s degrees each year, half of whom were women – chieﬂy from Women’s
College, Brown. Wiggin entered Brown in 1922 and was to serve as Richardson’s
assistant, which involved reading papers and keeping department records; she also
was to teach a section of students who had entered with only one year of algebra. In
addition, for an extra stipend, she was to teach a class of girls deﬁcient in algebra
during the ﬁrst semester and those deﬁcient in plane geometry during the second
semester. Two years later, in 1924, she completed her master’s degree having taken
work mainly with Richardson and Raymond Clare Archibald.

Wiggin was an instructor of mathematics at Hood College in Frederick, Mary-
land, from September 1924 until June 1927. On October 16, 1924, in reply to a
note from her, Richardson wrote, “I know that you will not forget the intellectual
ideal which inspired you to go on with graduate work” (Richardson Correspon-
dence 1921–1925). Richardson continued to encourage Wiggin to pursue the study
of mathematics. On October 9, 1925, after she reported to him on extra duties at
Hood because of illness of a colleague’s mother, duties that resulted in twenty-one
hours of teaching and looking after the department, he wrote, “If you care to take
some course for credit in absentia here at Brown, I think it could be arranged. I
know you will want to keep on with your studies in some sort of way. Possibly you
can go to Chicago some summer” (Richardson Correspondence 1921–1925). Wiggin
left Hood College in 1927 to enter the University of Chicago for further graduate
work. She was ﬁrst there for two years, as a teaching fellow in her second year,
1928–29, working mainly with Gilbert Ames Bliss.

In 1929 Wiggin joined the faculty of Randolph-Macon Woman’s College in Lynch-
burg, Virginia, as an associate professor. (The college was renamed Randolph
College and became coeducational in 2007.) Except for leaves she remained at

Randolph-Macon the rest of her career. Gillie Larew was also on the faculty, al-
though in Wiggin’s ﬁrst year there, Larew was on leave to study with Carath´eodory
in Munich. In a letter to Bliss of March 31, 1931, Larew commented about Wiggin:
“I want to thank you again for sending us Miss Wiggin and express the hope that
we may keep her for a long, long time. She is everything she should be both as
teacher and as a person. We have managed to do a little reading together and hope
to do more, when she has her thesis and examination oﬀ her hands . . . ” (University
of Chicago. Department of Mathematics. Records, Box 1, Folder 8, Special Col-
lections Research Center, University of Chicago Library). Wiggin returned to the
University of Chicago and was in residence 1935–36 when she ﬁnished her disserta-
tion in the calculus of variations; she was awarded the PhD in 1936. She returned
to Randolph-Macon and then was promoted to full professor in 1941.

Wiggin was on leave and was a lecturer at Wellesley College during 1942–43 and
taught at Emory University in summer 1949. In December of 1951 she attended a
computing laboratory seminar at the Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies. In
the summer of 1953 she attended the ﬁrst of the recently founded (1950) National
Science Foundation’s summer institutes in mathematics, this held at the University
of Colorado for college teachers. The following summer she attended another NSF
institute at the University of North Carolina. During 1954–55 she was on leave and
studied at the University of Chicago.

On June 20, 1956, Evelyn Wiggin married Sidney Casner, a retired lawyer, in
Chicago. Casner was born in 1890, grew up in Chicago, had degrees from the
University of Illinois and Kent College of Law, and attended the University of
Chicago Law School. He had practiced law and taught social sciences in Hyde Park
High School in Chicago. He also had taught in the DePaul University College of Law
and the Kent College of Law in Chicago. From July 1945 to August 1947, he was in
Europe, where he served as a military judge and taught at army university centers in
England, France, and Germany. According to a 1966 graduate of Randolph-Macon,
Sidney Casner had died by September 1962.

After her marriage, Evelyn Wiggin Casner continued in her position at Randolph-
Macon. For eight weeks during the summer of 1957, she was at Stanford on a grant
from the Social Sciences Research Council studying applications of mathematics to
the social sciences. Based on this work she developed an experimental course for
social science students at Randolph-Macon. During the late 1950s and early 1960s
she taught in seven NSF summer institutes for high school teachers.

Although Casner was reportedly a very shy person, she held leadership positions
in various organizations on campus and in Lynchburg. For example, she was presi-
dent of the college faculty club and local chapters of Sigma Xi and AAUP. She was
also exceedingly active in the community. Soon after her arrival in Virginia, she was
president of the Lynchburg Consumer Cooperative 1932–40. She was involved with
the YWCA, and over many years served as president (1958–62), trail supervisor,
and council member of the local Appalachian Trail Club. She was also a member
of the Virginia Academy of Science.

Evelyn Wiggin Casner died in Charlottesville, Virginia, at age sixty-four in 1964.
The Evelyn Casner Memorial Award was established by the Natural Bridge Ap-
palachian Trail Club to be presented to the club member who logged the most miles
during a year on hikes scheduled by the club.
