McDONALD, Emma (Whiton). August 3, 1886–July 7, 1948.
Colorado College (BA 1909), University of California (MA 1916, PhD 1932).

Emma Kirtland Whiton was born in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of Ella E.
(Lewis) (b. 1851) and Erastus T. Whiton (b. 1849), both originally of Connecticut.
In 1900 the family was living in Pueblo, Colorado, her parents had been married
twenty-three years, and two children were living of three born. Emma Kirtland’s
older sister was Myra Eleanor (b. 1882), who was also born in New York; their
father was an undertaker.

Emma Whiton graduated from Centennial High School in Pueblo, Colorado, in
1904. It appears that she taught for a year there before entering Colorado College
in Colorado Springs, where she earned her bachelor’s degree cum laude in 1909.
Florian Cajori was the head professor of mathematics there at that time. While at
Colorado College, her activities included Hypatia (a literary and social club), the
Dramatic Society, Dais, the YWCA, and the YWCA cabinet. After her graduation,
she returned to Centennial High School, where she taught history 1909–11 and
then mathematics until about 1916. She is listed in all of the school yearbooks
1909–1916 except for the year 1914–15. She is listed as being at a high school in
Pueblo in the April 1916 list of charter members of the MAA. The membership
list published later that year lists her as a graduate student at the University
of California living in a hotel in Berkeley. Her master’s thesis, written under the
direction of J. H. McDonald, was completed and approved by December 1916.
Whiton was in residence at the university 1916–17 and the ﬁrst semester 1917–18,
when she was a PhD candidate in mathematics.

Whiton was professor of mathematics at the University of Redlands in southern
California from January 1918 until 1923, when she joined the faculty as associate
professor at Mills College. She was at Mills a year and a half before resigning in
January 1925. She and her master’s thesis advisor, John Hector McDonald (1874–
1953), had married on December 19, 1924, when she was head resident of Mills Hall
and on the faculty at Mills. J. H. McDonald was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada,
earned his PhD as a student of Oskar Bolza at the University of Chicago in 1900,
and joined the faculty at California in January 1902.

In May 1932 Emma Whiton McDonald took her ﬁnal exam for her PhD at the
University of California. Her dissertation in number theory was directed by D. N.
Lehmer, and her minor subject was astronomy.

Emma Whiton McDonald used the name Mrs. J. H. McDonald in MAA mem-
bership lists in the late 1920s. She used Mrs. Kirtland McDonald in the 1933–34
membership list and published her dissertation in 1934 under the name Kirtland
McDonald. It appears that she and J. H. McDonald were living separately by 1930
and at some point were divorced. In 1944 he married Sophia Levy, a member of the
mathematics faculty at Berkeley who had a PhD in astronomy.

The last entries in MAA directories for Mrs. Kirtland McDonald are in 1933–34
at a hotel in Los Angeles and in 1935–36 with her address unknown. No record of
further professional activity in mathematics has been found, although she worked
for some years as a real estate broker in southern California. She lived in San Marino
and in South Pasadena. She was a member of the Daughters of the American
Revolution.
