ALLEN, Bess (Eversull). May 18, 1899–March 18, 1978.
University of Cincinnati (BA 1921, MA 1922, PhD 1924).

Bess Marie Eversull was born in Elmwood Place, a village adjacent to Cincin-
nati, Ohio, the ﬁrst of two daughters of Olive (Magrew) (1872–1954) and Warner
Solomon Eversull (1865–1944), both of Ohio. Her parents had married in 1896, and
the younger daughter, Edna (1901–1955), was born two years after Bess. Warner
Eversull was principal and later superintendent of a public school in the area.

Bess Eversull attended Woodward High School in Cincinnati before enrolling
at the University of Cincinnati where she received all of her formal postsecondary
education. She held a Washburn scholarship the ﬁrst two years of her undergraduate
work and graduated in 1921 with a combined major in mathematics and English
and a minor in French.

Eversull continued her studies at Cincinnati until she completed the work for
her doctorate with a minor in physics. She was a Baldwin fellow 1921–23, a Taft
fellow 1924, and assisted and taught intermittently. Both her 1922 master’s thesis
and her 1924 doctoral dissertation examined triple Fourier series, and each was
published the year she received the degree. She was the ﬁrst doctoral student of
Charles N. Moore and was the third person and the ﬁrst woman to earn a doctorate
in mathematics at Cincinnati.

Bess Eversull was an instructor at Smith College 1924–27. In October 1927 she
married Charles Easton Allen (1899–1975), and within a year they were living in
Detroit, where by 1930 Charles Allen was a civil engineer working as a building
inspector for the City of Detroit. Nearly twenty years after her marriage Allen
indicated in a job application that she had no children and that she had done
only volunteer work, mostly non-mathematical, since her marriage, except during
the war. She worked as a mathematician for the Jam Handy Organization, which
made ﬁlms for the armed services, from May 1942 until August 1943. Her volunteer
activities consisted of settlement work, YWCA board work, tutoring high school
and college students, and tutoring at the veterans’ hospital; in 1945 she taught in
the New Boston, Texas, high school as a substitute for two months.

In February 1947 Allen resumed her professional work by taking a position as
a regular substitute instructor at Wayne University (now Wayne State University)
in Detroit. She continued there as instructor 1948–50, assistant professor 1950–59,
associate professor 1959–64, and associate professor emeritus after her retirement
in 1964.

While at Wayne State University she taught elementary and beginning graduate
courses, was a regular attendee at department colloquia, prepared catalogue mate-
rial, was in charge of placement examinations, and supervised part-time instructors.
The department recommendation for her promotion to associate professor contains
the following observations: “In her unusual devotion to work in the classroom and
in interest in her students, Mrs. Allen sets an example for the rest of the staﬀ. . . .
The candidate is an excellent teacher. . . . She spends more time in giving individ-
ual assistance to students in and out of the class than any other member of the
department. . . . Without Mrs. Allen’s presence in the Math Department, much of
the essential detailed work would not be done” (Wayne State University Archives).
Allen’s activities outside the department included serving as a member of the
university honors convocation committee, as secretary of the WSU chapter of Phi

Beta Kappa, as liaison member between WSU and the AAUW, as director of the
Faculty Women’s Club, and as sponsor of the WSU chapter of Delta Omicron, a
national music fraternity. She often attended MAA meetings and wrote several re-
views for the Monthly. Professional aﬃliations included the Industrial Mathematics
Society, Detroit, and the Michigan Academy of Science, Arts, and Letters. After
her retirement from Wayne State in 1964, she taught for a few years in the late
1960s at the Detroit Institute of Technology.

Charles Allen died in 1975, and Bess Allen died at her home in Detroit, Michigan,
in 1978, two months before her seventy-ninth birthday. After cremation her remains
were interred in the Evergreen Cemetery in Detroit.
