RAYL, Adrienne S. September 25, 1898–November 27, 1989.
Tulane University (BA 1924, MA 1934), University of Chicago (PhD 1939).

Adrienne Sophie Rayl was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the daughter of So-
phie Catherine (Schick) (1874–1953) and James John Rayl (1871–1952). Her parents
were born in New Orleans and were married on January 11, 1898. Her father had
an elementary school education, was a cigar classer in 1900, and later was a postal
employee; her mother received a high school and normal school education and be-
came an elementary school teacher. Adrienne Rayl was the eldest of eight children.
Her siblings were Harold James (b. 1900), Ruth (1903–1987), Naomi (1904–1990),
Elsa (1907–1994), Leonora (ca. 1909–1921), Mabel (1910–1989), and Sophie (1913–
1994).

Adrienne Rayl attended public grade school and Girls High School in New Or-
leans, graduating from the latter in 1915 ﬁrst in her class of ﬁfty-one. She attended
the New Orleans Normal School from 1915 to 1917 and graduated, ﬁrst in her class,
with a teaching diploma in 1917.

During the next twenty-two years Rayl taught in the New Orleans public school
system and completed all of her undergraduate and graduate work. In 1917 she
began teaching seventh and eighth grades at the Beauregard School and began
working toward her bachelor’s degree by taking courses for teachers and summer
school classes at Tulane University. She received her BA in education in 1924 and
continued teaching at the elementary school until 1929, when she was transferred
to the Edward Douglas White High School to teach mathematics. While teaching
at the high school, where she remained until 1939, she attended summer school and
afternoon classes, including classes by Nola Anderson (Haynes) and by Marie Weiss,
at Tulane and earned her MA in 1934. She immediately began further graduate work
at the University of Chicago in the summer of 1934. She took classes there for ﬁve
consecutive summers and the academic year 1936–37 and ﬁnished her dissertation
under Walter Bartky in August 1939. Rayl’s dissertation concerned the four-body
problem. She had begun work in this area while at Tulane and had solved a problem
related to the three-body problem when taking a celestial mechanics course there
from H. E. Buchanan.

Adrienne S. Rayl spent the next three decades in Birmingham at the University
of Alabama Extension Center (now the University of Alabama at Birmingham).
When she arrived, there were no women students at the school. In a newspaper
article at the time of her retirement, Rayl was quoted as recalling, “The Center
had been open only three years when I ﬁrst came . . . and although there were
only 116 students enrolled, it was a wonderful opportunity for the working man to
attend our evening classes.” She was instructor 1939–41, assistant professor 1941–
47, associate professor 1947–52, and professor 1952–69. She retired in 1969 with the
rank of professor emeritus. While there she taught calculus, diﬀerential equations,
vector analysis, complex variables, and advanced calculus among other courses. She
was also chairman of the Division of Mathematics.

Rayl was a member of the Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod. In the early 1980s
she moved back to New Orleans, where she was living at the time of her death in
1989 at ninety-one. She is buried in the Greenwood Cemetery in New Orleans.
Organizational aﬃliations: AMS, MAA, AAAS, Sigma Delta Epsilon.
