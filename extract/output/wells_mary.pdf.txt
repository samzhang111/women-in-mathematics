WELLS, Mary Evelyn. August 20, 1881–October 7, 1965.
Mount Holyoke College (BA 1904), University of Chicago (MS 1907, PhD
1915).

Mary Evelyn Wells was born in LeRaysville, Pennsylvania, the second of three children
of Delphine (Whitford) (b. 1854) and William Henry Wells (b. 1851). Her older brother,
George E., was born in May 1879; her younger sister, Anna M., was born in May 1885. Her
parents and siblings were born in Pennsylvania, where her father was listed as a farmer in
the 1880 census. In 1900 her parents had been married twenty-ﬁve years, and the family
was living in Naugatuck, Connecticut, where her father was a carpenter. In 1910 her
mother was widowed, living with her other daughter and son-in-law in Naugatuck, and
working at home as a dressmaker.

Mary Wells received most of her elementary education at home and in the public schools
of Brushville and LeRaysville, Pennsylvania. She attended a little over a year of grammar
school and four years of high school in Naugatuck and graduated from the academic course
in the Naugatuck high school in 1900. That fall she entered Mount Holyoke College, from
which she graduated four years later as a mathematics major. She stayed at Mount Holyoke
as a department tutor in mathematics for a year after her graduation. She was later elected
a Mount Holyoke alumna member of Phi Beta Kappa.

In the fall of 1905, Wells entered the University of Chicago, where she studied for three
quarters in each of the years 1905–06 and 1906–07. She was a fellow the second year
and received her master’s degree in 1907. She became an instructor at Mount Holyoke
College that fall and taught there for ﬁve years before returning to the University of
Chicago as a graduate student in 1912. She stayed at Chicago two years, with a fellowship
from Mount Holyoke 1912–13 and a fellowship from Chicago 1913–14 during which she
taught one quarter. While at Chicago for her master’s and doctoral degrees, she studied
under E. H. Moore, H. Maschke, L. E. Dickson, H. E. Slaught, A. C. Lunn, and E. J.
Wilczynski in mathematics and under F. R. Moulton and W. D. MacMillan in astronomy.
Her dissertation was supervised by E. H. Moore, and the PhD degree was awarded in 1915.
Wells had also served as a reader in mathematics for the College Entrance Examination
Board in New York City from 1908 to 1913.

During 1914–15 Mary Evelyn Wells was an acting associate professor at Oberlin College,
as a temporary replacement for Mary Sinclair, who was away for her ﬁrst sabbatical. In
the fall of 1915, Wells joined the faculty at Vassar College, where she remained except for
leaves until her retirement in 1948. She was instructor 1915–20, assistant professor 1920–
22, associate professor 1922–28, professor 1928–48, and emeritus professor after 1948. From
1936 to 1948 she was chairman of the department. According to Benjamin Lotto at Vassar,
her teaching included a secret course in cryptography for the navy during World War II;
the course was taught from about 1943 until the end of the war and had been requested
by the navy in order to train women with mathematical and language skills.

Wells traveled abroad in the summers of 1922 and 1924, with records showing her
returning to New York by ship from Southampton and Hamburg, respectively. She then
had a leave of absence from Vassar from 1926 to 1928. During the ﬁrst year, 1926–27,
she was an exchange professor and head of the department at Women’s Christian College,
University of Madras, India. The next year, 1927–28, she studied at the Istituto Fisico of
the University of Rome, where Vito Volterra was professor. She had corresponded with
him in 1925, before she left for India, and in 1928 she published a translation into English
of Volterra’s 1926 paper that describes his famous theory on population growth. This
paper appeared in a journal published in Denmark by the Conseil international pour
l’exploration de la mer. Four letters Wells wrote to Volterra are in the archives of the
Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei.

According to her faculty ﬁle at Vassar, Wells translated other works, most notably
Bernhard Riemann’s “On the hypotheses which lie at the foundations of geometry,” which
appeared in A Source Book in Mathematics by David Eugene Smith (New York: McGraw-
Hill, 1929; reissued New York: Dover Publications, 1959). That translation is credited to
H. S. White, and a note in her faculty ﬁle indicates that “Miss Wells said her name was
omitted by mistake.”

During 1936–37, Wells had a leave of absence from Vassar and returned to Women’s
Christian College, University of Madras. She served as a trustee of the University of Madras
from 1930 to 1937 and again after 1948. She was also a director of St. Christopher’s College
in Madras 1928–37, of Women’s Christian College in Madras 1927–37 and after 1948, and
of Women’s Christian College in Tokyo 1930–37. In May 1940 she wrote to Helen Owens
that she had “published in India and Denmark” (Owens Papers). The latter publication
presumably refers to her 1928 translation of Volterra, but her Indian publication remains
a mystery.

Wells joined the AMS in 1908, about a year after she received her master’s degree, and
from that time until 1942, except when abroad, she normally attended several meetings a
year of the society. In about 1940 she described herself as an Episcopalian whose favorite
recreations were skating and climbing. Other favorite leisure activities were reading, walk-
ing, and gardening. Under religious activities, she mentioned that she was on a community
church board for several years.

For many years Wells maintained a home in Southport, Maine, where she spent some
summers. In 1957 Wells was living in Naugatuck, where her widowed sister, Anna, a for-
mer teacher, made her home. Wells described her main avocation as work for the Women’s
Christian College in Madras. In November 1958 she moved from Naugatuck to Wethers-
ﬁeld, Connecticut. It appears that she was living in Vermont by about 1959. At various
times she used addresses in Rutland and nearby Pittsford, near her nephew.

Mary Evelyn Wells died at age eighty-four in 1965 at a nursing home in Rutland,
Vermont, after a long illness and was cremated in Troy, New York. She was survived by
her nephew in Pittsford, several grandnephews, and a grandniece. The Mary E. Wells
and Gertrude Smith Fund, honoring Wells and another long-time mathematics faculty
member, was established at Vassar for students demonstrating excellence in mathematics.
