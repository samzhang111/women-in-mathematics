GIBBENS, Gladys. January 21, 1893–September 24, 1983.
H. Sophie Newcomb College (BA 1914), Tulane University (MA 1916), Univer-
sity of Chicago (PhD 1920).

Gladys Elizabeth Corson Gibbens was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the el-
dest of three children of Belle Frances (Arbour) (1866–1954) and William Joseph
Gibbens (1864–1934). Her mother was born in Baton Rouge and attended a pri-
vate academy before her marriage in 1891. Her father was also born in Louisiana,
attended Louisiana State University, and became an engineer. His occupation was
described variously as sugar engineer, sugar machinist, proprietor of mill supplies,
and merchant of machinery. The other children in the family were (Elizabeth) Hath-
away (1894–1971) and William Joseph Jr. (1896–1976).

Gladys E. C. Gibbens attended private kindergarten and public grade school and
was a boarding student at Ursuline Academy, a private Roman Catholic school for
girls in New Orleans. After graduating from Ursuline Academy in 1910, she entered
H. Sophie Newcomb College, a degree-granting, coordinate college for women in
Tulane University in New Orleans. She was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta social
sorority.

Gibbens graduated in 1914, and from 1914 to 1917 she held a teaching fellowship
in mathematics at Newcomb College while she was studying at Tulane University.
She received her master’s degree in 1916, one of ﬁve master’s degrees granted by
Tulane at that June commencement.

In 1917 Gibbens moved to Chicago, where she studied for nine quarters at the
University of Chicago during the next three years. In 1917–18 she was on the
program committee of the Junior Mathematical Club, and in February 1918 she
spoke at the club meeting about the lima¸con, the topic of her master’s thesis. In
1918–20 she also held a fellowship in the mathematics department. Gibbens took
courses with E. H. Moore, L. E. Dickson, G. A. Bliss, E. J. Wilczynski, and F. R.
Moulton, and wrote her dissertation under the direction of Wilczynski.

After receiving her PhD from the University of Chicago in 1920, Gibbens took a
position as instructor at the University of Minnesota. She remained there through-
out her career: as instructor 1920–25, assistant professor 1925–47, associate profes-
sor 1947–58, and associate professor emeritus after her retirement in 1958. Her
slightly younger colleague Elizabeth Carlson had a similar employment history
there. The two also shared an oﬃce for many years.

Gibbens taught a variety of courses at Minnesota. They included elementary and
advanced undergraduate courses in algebra, geometry, and analysis, and several
dealing with the mathematics of ﬁnance. She was usually course chairman for at
least one course every quarter; this included administering the ﬁnal examinations.
She was long associated with Raymond W. Brink, department chairman after 1940,
in a course in the ﬁeld of general education. She generally worked during a summer
session each year, often teaching diﬀerential equations or an upper level geometry
course. In the summers of 1935 and 1936, she and Elizabeth Carlson co-taught a
reading course for seniors. She also taught in the War Training Program in the
summers of 1943 and 1944 and served as acting chairman of the department for
several weeks each summer from the mid-1940s until near the time of her retirement.
While at the University of Minnesota, Gibbens regularly attended meetings of
the Minnesota Section of the MAA. At her ﬁrst meeting in June 1921 she was

elected to the executive committee of the section. The following year she served as
acting secretary and was elected to the executive committee two more times during
the 1920s.

Gibbens returned to New Orleans after her retirement in 1958. In the late 1930s,
she indicated that her hobbies were gardening and music and that her favorite
recreations were golf and boating. In 1982 she wrote that she had worked as a
volunteer teacher in a hospital for crippled children. Gibbens died at age ninety
at Tulane Medical Center in New Orleans after a long illness. Interment was in
Lafayette Cemetery No. 1 in New Orleans.
