JACKSON, Rosa L. May 7, 1883–January 15, 1967.
Western College for Women (BA 1904), University of Chicago (MS 1922, PhD
1928).

Rosa Lea Jackson was the daughter of Mary Thom (Palmer) (b. ca. 1853) and
James Knox Polk Jackson (1842–1925), natives of Tennessee. Her father was a
farmer. There were four children in the family: a son, Hugh, born in about 1871,
and three daughters, Willie Kate (1872–1943), Julia M. (1877–1963), and Rosa Lea.
Her father was widowed by 1900. Rosa Lea Jackson attended public elementary and
secondary schools in Ripley, Tennessee, where she was born.

Jackson entered The Western, a College and Seminary for Women, in Oxford,
Ohio, in 1900. After her graduation in 1904 from the renamed Western College
for Women, she was at Athens Female College (now Athens State University) in
Alabama until 1910, as head of the mathematics department 1904–07 and as dean
and professor of mathematics 1907–10.

In 1910–11 and summer 1911 she attended the University of Chicago as a grad-
uate student in mathematics. The following academic year she taught history and
was dean at Central College for Women in Lexington, Missouri, after which she
taught at Ripley High School in her home town in Tennessee 1912–14 and was an
acting adjunct professor at Randolph-Macon Woman’s College 1914–16. She re-
turned to Athens College as professor of mathematics and dean from 1916 to 1921.
She was also head of the department when she joined the MAA in 1920. Some of
the time she was at Athens College, her sister Julia was a professor of history and
the registrar there.

In 1921–22 Rosa L. Jackson again attended the University of Chicago full time;
she wrote her thesis in the calculus of variations and received her master’s degree
in 1922. She was instructor at Northwestern University from 1922 until 1926 and
attended the University of Chicago in the summers of 1925 and 1926. She continued
at Chicago during the academic year 1926–27, as a fellow, and in summer 1927. In
1927–28 she was instructor in mathematics at Leland Stanford Junior University,
where her teaching schedule was listed as analytic geometry, diﬀerential and integral
calculus, complex variables, calculus of variations, and a directed reading. She also
ﬁnished her dissertation in calculus of variations and received her PhD from the
University of Chicago in August 1928.

After receiving her doctorate, Jackson was an instructor at Hunter College from
1928 to 1930, following which she was instructor in the women’s division of the
newly opened Brooklyn College 1930–31. In 1931 she joined the faculty at Alabama
College, State College for Women (now the University of Montevallo) in Montevallo,
Alabama, where she remained as professor and head of the mathematics department
until she retired as professor emeritus in 1959, when she was nearly seventy-six. The
school had become coeducational in 1956.

Jackson regularly attended meetings of the Southeastern Section of the MAA in
the 1930s; she continued attending, although more sporadically, through at least
1950. In 1937 Alabama College started a chapter of the mathematics honorary fra-
ternity Kappa Mu Epsilon, and Rosa Lea Jackson served as corresponding secretary
of the chapter at least from 1950 until 1952.
