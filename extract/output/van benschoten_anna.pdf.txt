VAN BENSCHOTEN, Anna L. August 12, 1866–September 18, 1927.
Cornell University (BS 1894, PhD 1908), University of Chicago (MS 1900).

Anna Lavinia Van Benschoten was born in Elmira, New York, the daughter of Mary
Jane (Pugsley) (1841–1885) and Moses M. Van Benschoten (1839–1872), both of New
York. During the Civil War, Moses Van Benschoten served in the infantry from May 1861
until May 1863 and again from September 1864 until June 1865. Her parents married in
November 1865. In 1870 Anna and her mother, Mary Van Benschoten, a music teacher,
were living with Anna’s maternal grandfather in Binghamton, New York.

Anna Van Benschoten received her primary and secondary education in the public
schools of Binghamton, and she graduated from Binghamton Central High School in 1886.
By this time both of her parents had died, and she was listed as boarding with Mary
E. T. Ames in an 1888 Binghamton, New York, directory. Ames is later listed as parent
or guardian on Van Benschoten’s Cornell transcript. Although it is unclear what Van
Benschoten was doing throughout the period 1886–91, according to a 1928 letter written
by Amy J. Douglass, who lived with Van Benschoten from the end of 1921 until her death
in 1927, she traveled in Europe (England, Scotland, France, Germany, Switzerland, and
Italy) from June to December 1890.

Van Benschoten enrolled as an undergraduate at Cornell University in 1891 and studied
under James E. Oliver, James McMahon, and George W. Jones. Most of the courses she
took were in the general area of geometry, although she also took courses in algebra and a
year-long seminar on mathematics pedagogy. After graduating from Cornell in 1894, she
taught at Binghamton Central High School 1894–98. She spent the summers of 1897 and
1898 and the following two academic years at the University of Chicago before receiving
her master’s degree in mathematics and astronomy in 1900.

After receiving her master’s degree, Van Benschoten spent a year traveling in Europe
and taking courses in mathematics and astronomy in G¨ottingen. In particular, she was
in Felix Klein’s projective geometry lecture in winter 1900–01. By that time a number of
women mathematics students from the United States had studied with Klein and others
in G¨ottingen.

In 1901 Van Benschoten began her college teaching career as professor at Wells College,
a women’s college in Aurora, New York. She assumed the position of professor that was
vacated when Annie MacKinnon (Fitch) married. Van Benschoten was on the faculty at
Wells until 1920, except for leaves of absence. During most of her ﬁrst decade there she was
the only one giving instruction in mathematics. During most of her second decade she was
joined by one instructor. Van Benschoten ﬁrst took a leave in the academic year 1906–07
to resume her graduate studies at Cornell before receiving her doctorate in 1908. One of
her students at Wells was Anna Mayme Howe, class of 1908, who later earned her PhD in
mathematics at Cornell. Van Benschoten had additional leaves during the second semester
of 1914–15 and part of 1916–17; Helen Owens replaced her during both of these leaves. Van
Benschoten also had a leave of absence 1918–20 after which she retired because of ill health.
She spent part of the year 1918 at the University of Arizona teaching mathematics to “boys
of the Student Army Corps” (Amy J. Douglass to Foster M. Coﬃn, 27 February 1928,
Box 133, Deceased Alumni Files, #41-2-877, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections,
Cornell University Library) and moved to Whittier, California, in about 1921. According to
Douglass, “She gave up continuous teaching because of impaired health due to Rheumatic
Arthritis and during her six years of residence in Whittier she did private tutoring” and
taught at Whittier College “from January to April 1924.” Her obituary indicates that she
was at Whittier temporarily to replace a regular faculty member who was away.

Van Benschoten was a charter member of the MAA and was a member of the social
sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma. Douglass reported that in addition to her earlier travels

in Europe, Van Benschoten made a third trip abroad to Norway, Sweden, Russia, and
Germany, and that she also visited Alaska and Jamaica.

Van Benschoten died in her home in Whittier, California, at age sixty-one. Funeral
services took place at St. Matthias Episcopal Church after which her remains were sent
to Binghamton, New York, for interment. She left no immediate relatives.
