DELEVIE, Jeanette (Fox). January 13, 1912–July 29, 1997.
New York University (BS 1931), Yale University (PhD 1935).

Jeanette Fox was born in New York, New York, the second of four children of
Sophie (Levy) (b. ca. 1885) and Jacob Fox (1874–1935). Her mother was born in
New York; her father was born in Russia, immigrated to the United States as a
young man, and was naturalized in 1905. They married in about 1906. According
to census records, her father was in the grocery business in 1910 and was an electric
broker in 1920. Later he was president of the Owners and Tenants Electric Company.
The other children were Florence (1906–1999), who earned a PhD in psychology;
Victor (b. ca. 1914); and Helen (b. ca. 1916). At some point her parents were
divorced. Her mother was still living at the time of her father’s death in 1935.

Jeanette Fox graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn and lived at
home while attending Washington Square College of New York University, where
she majored in mathematics and minored in physics. During her junior year, 1929–
30, she studied at the University of Munich; she graduated from NYU in 1931. Fox
studied at the University of Berlin 1931–32 and was a fellow in mathematics at
Yale University 1932–35, where she was elected to Sigma Xi. In 1935 she received
her doctorate, having written her dissertation under the direction of Oystein Ore.
In 1935 Jeanette Fox married Albert Sol Keston (1911–1992). Albert Keston,
who was born in New York, received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the
University of Michigan and a doctorate in chemistry from Yale in 1935. He taught
chemistry at the City College of New York (CCNY) before joining the faculty at the
New York University College of Medicine. Later he was at Mount Sinai School of
Medicine. He was a physical chemist most noted for developing the glucose-sensitive
tape used by diabetics to test sugar levels.

During the academic year 1938–39 Jeanette Fox Keston taught at Brooklyn Col-
lege during the day as a substitute, that is, on an hourly wage. She was also an
instructor in the evening session 1938–41. The ﬁrst of her two children, a daughter,
was born in January 1942. She again taught during the day as a substitute from
January to June 1943. Her son was born in January 1944. The Kestons were sepa-
rated when the children were young and divorced in 1950. Their daughter received
a PhD in experimental psychology in 1967.

Jeanette Fox Keston was a temporary lecturer in a veterans’ program at Hunter
College 1946–48 and remained in a temporary position at Hunter the following
year. The next two years, 1949–51, she was an assistant professor at Jersey City
Junior College. Keston again taught at Brooklyn College starting in 1953; she was a
substitute 1953–56 and a lecturer 1956–57. She then began her association with the
mathematics faculty at CCNY. She remained until 1971, by which time it had be-
come City College, CUNY. She was an instructor September 1957–December 1961,
an assistant professor January 1961–December 1966, and an associate professor
from January 1967 until her retirement in 1971. In the early 1960s, she coauthored
two mathematics research papers with others at City College. She taught several
upper level courses in her ﬁeld of algebra as well as the course in abstract algebra in
the graduate school of education. During Saturdays of the academic year 1963–64
she also taught an NSF-sponsored course in number theory for high school students.
In 1964 she was joined at City College by Miriam B. Mazur, who had been a fellow
graduate student at Yale, and who had earned her PhD there a year before Jeanette

Fox Keston. Until Mazur was hired, Keston was in charge of most of the courses
related to the preparation of teachers and served as the department representative
to the school of education as well as chairman of the departmental committee on
teacher preparation.

While traveling in Europe, Jeanette Keston met, and later married, Solomon
Delevie (1907–1992), a native of Pennsylvania who was living in San Francisco.
They appear to have married at the end of the 1969–70 academic year, and Jeanette
Delevie moved to California while she was on a sabbatical leave 1970–71. She was
granted a waiver from the condition of returning after a sabbatical and retired.
On June 25, 1971, Jean Delevie wrote to Fritz Steinhardt, then chairman of the
mathematics department at City College that “meeting Sol [Delevie] was the start
of a fairy tale and ‘they lived very happily ever after.’ It can happen in real life”
(Keston, Jeanette Fox; Mathematics Department Faculty Personnel File, Archives
and Special Collections Division of the CCNY Libraries). In 1997, at the age of
eighty-ﬁve, Jeanette Delevie died at home in San Francisco of cardiorespiratory
arrest as a result of coronary artery disease.
