SHEA, Sister Ann Elizabeth. September 19, 1900–May 14, 1957.
University of Kansas (BA 1927), University of Wisconsin (MA 1931, PhD 1934).

Mary Gertrude Shea, known as Gertrude when she was young, was born and
reared in St. Joseph, Missouri, the second of four children of Elizabeth (Raney),
born in 1874 in Missouri, and Martin J. Shea (1864–1933), a native of Kentucky.
In 1900 her parents, who at that time had been married four years, were living
in St. Joseph with their two-year-old son. Also in the household were Elizabeth’s
mother and sister and Martin’s sister. Martin Shea was a policeman. By 1910 all of
the family’s children were born: Gertrude’s brother Lawrence was three years older
than she; her brother Martin was two years younger; and her sister, Catherine, was
seven years younger. Her father was a sergeant in the city police department.

In the 1920 census Gertrude Shea’s occupation was listed as stenographer for
a railroad clearing house. She entered the Novitiate of the Sisters of Charity of
Leavenworth in 1922, made ﬁrst vows in 1924, and was thereafter known as Sister
Ann Elizabeth Shea. She graduated from the newly named Saint Mary College, a
junior college for women in Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1923, the ﬁrst year instruction
at the postsecondary level was added. The school, which was chartered in 1860, was
formerly St. Mary’s Academy; in 2003 it became the University of Saint Mary.

After completing her bachelor’s degree in 1927 at the University of Kansas,
Sister Ann Elizabeth taught mathematics until 1930 at Immaculata High School in
Leavenworth, Kansas. In 1930 she entered the University of Wisconsin to study for
her master’s degree. Department minutes of that period note that a master’s thesis
for her was considered optional; in February of 1931 the department considered,
presumably favorably, her request for approval of the following courses to complete
her master’s degree: real variables (one year), algebraic geometry (one year), and
higher algebra (ﬁrst semester). She received the master’s degree in 1931.

From 1931 until her death in 1957, Sister Ann Elizabeth was associated with
Saint Mary College. The college, from which she had graduated in 1923, had just
added an upper division curriculum in 1930 and became a four-year institution in
1932. From 1931 to 1933 she was instructor of mathematics. At the same time,
she continued her graduate studies at the University of Wisconsin, where she was
in residence 1933–34 and completed her work, including a dissertation in algebraic
geometry under the direction of Theodore Bennett, in 1934.

After receiving her PhD, the ﬁrst of the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth to earn
a doctorate, Sister Ann Elizabeth was professor and chairman of the mathematics
department and later registrar of the college. In her latter role, she was also a
member of the Association of Collegiate Registrars and the Kansas Association
of Collegiate Registrars, for which she served as secretary. In 1940 she described
her positions as registrar and chairman of the division of natural sciences and
mathematics. She later became a member of the board of control of the college.
She also taught in the summer of 1937 at Mount Mary College and in the summer
of 1942 at Nazareth College. In the late 1930s and into the 1940s she attended
meetings of the Kansas Section of the MAA.

In 1954 Sister Ann Elizabeth Shea was appointed treasurer-general of the cor-
poration of the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth. Her 1957 death in Leavenworth
at age ﬁfty-six from a cerebral hemorrhage was sudden and unexpected. Burial was
