BARNES, Mabel (Schmeiser). July 29, 1905–February 22, 1993.
Cornell College (BA 1926), University of Wisconsin (MA 1928), Ohio State
University (PhD 1931).

Mabel Frances Schmeiser was the second of six children of Christena M. (Weh-
meyer) (1879–1953) and Emanuel Schmeiser (1872–1942), both Iowa natives who
had married in 1902. Her mother was educated through the eighth grade, and her
father, a farmer, received some elementary education. All of the children were born
in Wapello, in southeastern Iowa just a few miles from the Mississippi River, and
all attended college; the four oldest were graduates of Cornell College in Mount
Vernon, Iowa, about sixty miles north of Wapello; the two youngest attended Iowa
State University. Mabel Schmeiser’s siblings were Agnes P. (1903–2002), who was
a teacher; Martin L. (1907–1976), a civil engineer who also did some graduate
work at Iowa State; Mary M. (1909–1991), a dietician and small business owner;
L. Josephine (1912–1999), a graduate of Iowa State who was a dress designer for
a department store and who was the wife of a president of Pennsylvania State
University; and L. Maurice (1919–2008), who attended Iowa State for two years
and became a farmer.

Mabel Schmeiser began her education in a one-room country school and gradu-
ated from the high school in Wapello in 1922 before going to Cornell College. In the
spring of 1926, before her graduation, she was chosen as recipient of the mathemat-
ics department fellowship at the University of Wisconsin, where she subsequently
spent the next academic year. She received her master’s degree from Wisconsin
in 1928 after having entered Ohio State University for further graduate work in
1927. She was at Ohio State 1927–30 and the summers of 1930 and 1931. She was
a graduate assistant the ﬁrst two years and a university fellow the last year.

Through a teachers’ employment agency, Schmeiser found a position as professor
and acting chairman of the mathematics department at Nebraska State Normal
School and Teachers College (now Wayne State College) in Wayne. She was there,
substituting for someone on leave of absence 1930–31, the year before ﬁnishing her
dissertation and receiving her PhD from Ohio State. She continued in that position
until 1933, when her predecessor returned to resume the position.

During the Depression, with jobs hard to ﬁnd, Schmeiser applied to and was
accepted at the recently opened Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. She
spoke about her year there, as well as other aspects of her life and career, at a
panel on women in American mathematics at the centennial celebration of the
AMS in Providence in 1988. She noted that there were still no jobs at the end
of the academic year 1933–34, so “six men and I from the Institute and from
Princeton University took a special qualifying exam to be taken on as substitutes
for mathematics teachers on leave from New York City high schools. Our duties
were to teach light schedules in the high schools to which we were assigned and to
give jointly an alertness course, as it was called, for high school teachers. It qualiﬁed
them for raises” (1988, 7). Schmeiser was a substitute at Wadleigh High School in
Manhattan.

On July 3, 1935, Mabel Schmeiser and John Landes Barnes were married. He was
born in New Jersey in 1906, had a bachelor’s degree and master’s degree in electrical
engineering from MIT, and a master’s degree and a 1934 PhD in mathematics from
Princeton. They ﬁrst lived in Massachusetts, where J. L. Barnes had a position

as assistant professor at Tufts College (now University). Although Mabel Barnes
did not have a regular position at Tufts and normally gave her home address for
the AMS membership list, in September 1938 she used the college as her mailing
address. She later reported, “I kept my hand in somewhat by marking papers and
substituting for [my husband] when he was away, and by helping him edit the
mathematics section of Eshbach’s Handbook of Engineering Fundamentals, second
edition” (1988, 7).

John Barnes remained at Tufts until 1942, during which time he was promoted
to professor of mathematics and served as chairman of applied mathematics as well
as acting chairman of electrical engineering. During that period their two children
were born. George Gared Barnes, born in December 1936 in Boston, became an
engineer, having earned a bachelor’s degree in physics, and master’s degrees in
engineering, in statistics, and in business administration. Lynne Ries Barnes Small,
born in August 1940 in Philadelphia, has a PhD in mathematics from Yale and is
a professor at the University of San Diego.

During World War II John Barnes was on leave from Tufts and did war work
with Bell Telephone Laboratories, ﬁrst in New York and then in New Jersey. They
returned to Tufts after the war, and Mabel Barnes was hired as an assistant profes-
sor at Tufts for 1946–47, partly because of the inﬂux of veterans. She later noted,
“nepotism and my being a woman were overlooked. Desperation again overcame
prejudice” (1988, 7). Although she was rehired for the next year, they moved to
California where her husband had taken a position as professor in engineering at
UCLA. He remained there until his retirement in 1974. In addition to many con-
sulting positions over the years, John L. Barnes was founder and president, from
1957 until 1976, of Systems Corporation of America. He died in La Jolla in 1976
shortly before his seventieth birthday.

In 1950 Mabel Barnes resumed her career by taking a position at Occidental
College in Los Angeles, where she was instructor 1950–51, lecturer 1951–52, assis-
tant professor 1952–56, associate professor 1956–64, professor 1964–71, and then
professor emeritus. In 1955 she became the editor of “Installation of New Chap-
ters” in Pentagon, the journal of Kappa Mu Epsilon. She served until 1961 and was
succeeded by Sister Helen Sullivan.

Lynne Barnes Small wrote in 1997 that her mother “liked to travel, especially to
remote places, and took many trips with the Sierra Club and/or one of her grand-
sons. . . . The generation-skipping trips had a certain charm: picture grandmother
and grandson in the 9-to-12-year-old range traveling to Alaska or to remote parts
of northern Canada.” Her main activity during retirement was working on conser-
vation with both the Sierra Club and with the Desert Protective Society. She also
was a volunteer at the Sherman Oaks Hospital for many years.

Mabel Barnes died in Los Angeles in 1993 at age eighty-seven.
