BABCOCK, Wealthy. November 18, 1895–April 10, 1990.
University of Kansas (BA 1919, MA 1922, PhD 1926).

Wealthy Consuelo Babcock was born on a farm in Washington County, Kansas,
near the Nebraska border. She was the second child of Ella (Kerr) (b. 1872), a
Kansas native, and Cassius Lincoln Babcock (b. 1859), originally from Indiana.
Their son, Dale, was born in 1891, four years before Wealthy. In 1900 Cassius
Babcock was a farmer; in 1910 the family was living in Hiawatha, in the northeast
corner of Kansas, and he was a carpenter. In 1920 Wealthy and her parents were
living in Steele City, Nebraska, just across the border from Washington County,
Kansas.

Wealthy Babcock graduated in 1913 from Washington County High School and
taught for one year at Liberty School followed by a year at Lone Mound, both one-
room country schools in Washington County. She then attended the University of
Kansas where she was a member of the women’s basketball team, an early indication
of her interest in sports. After receiving her BA in 1919, she taught for a year at
Neodesha High School in southeastern Kansas.

Babcock then returned to the University of Kansas, where she was to spend the
rest of her career. She was an instructor starting in 1920, while also earning her
graduate degrees: a master’s in 1922 and a doctorate with a minor in physics in
1926. She was promoted to assistant professor in 1926 and to associate professor
in 1940; she retired at that rank in 1966. During her tenure on the Kansas faculty
Babcock regularly attended meetings of the Kansas Section of the MAA.

According to G. Baley Price’s 1975 history of the University of Kansas mathe-
matics department, she was known as an outstanding teacher. She was the depart-
ment’s librarian for more than thirty years, and this contribution was acknowledged
in 1966 by the naming of the Wealthy Babcock Mathematics Library. She served on
many committees on scholarships and awards and was particularly active in the KU
Alumni Association’s activities, for which she received the Fred Ellsworth Medal-
lion, the highest award for service, in 1977. This honor was noted again in October
2002 in the article “Old Home Town – 25, 40 and 100 Years Ago Today” in the
Lawrence Journal-World. Scholarships that have been given in her name include
the Black–Babcock mathematics scholarship, the Wealthy Babcock scholarship, the
Charles H. Ashton–Wealthy Babcock scholarship, and the Wealthy Babcock New
Student scholarship. A ﬂoor of Templin Hall, a residence hall at the university, is
named the Wealthy Babcock House.

Babcock’s career paralleled in many ways that of Florence Black, a close friend
and colleague at the University of Kansas, with whom she shared many interests.
Black, too, received a PhD from Kansas in 1926 and was on the mathematics
faculty for her entire career. They were both avid sports fans, faithfully attending
university football and basketball games. In 2005 a columnist for the Lawrence
Journal-World noted that “I go back to the days when the likes of Florence Black,
Wealthy Babcock and Elizabeth Lawson knew as much about KU hoops as any
living creatures. They were ﬁxtures in Hoch Auditorium and the ﬁeldhouse for
eons.” Both Babcock and Black were interested in camping and the out-of-doors.
Price notes that Babcock owned a stable of horses that she and Black rode. Both
were elected to the University of Kansas Women’s Hall of Fame in 1973. The College

of Liberal Arts and Sciences reported in 2005 that the Florence Black and Wealthy
Babcock Professorship in Mathematics was newly established.

Wealthy Babcock died at ninety-four at Presbyterian Manor in Lawrence, Kansas,
in 1990. Survivors included a nephew, great-nephews and great-nieces, and great-
great-nephews and great-great-nieces. She was cremated with inurnment in the
Pioneer Cemetery on the campus of the university.
