CHANLER, Josephine H. April 7, 1906–December 23, 1992.
Western Kentucky State Normal School and Teachers College (BA 1927),
University of Illinois (MA 1930, PhD 1933).

Josephine Hughes Chanler was the only child of Louisa Castle (Hughes) (1869–
1948) and James H. Chanler. Although she was born in St. Louis, she and her
mother were there only brieﬂy, staying in a friend’s apartment while her father was
away looking for timber for a lumber company. A few weeks after Josephine’s birth,
she and her mother returned to Bowling Green, Kentucky, where her mother’s
family lived. Her father was away from the family after that time, although her
parents corresponded until about 1918.

Josephine Chanler’s mother had begun teaching at age eighteen and had at-
tended, but not received a degree from, Pleasant J. Potter College, a college for
women with preparatory and degree programs in Bowling Green that was char-
tered in 1890. Her mother taught in grade school and then in high school in nearby
Franklin, Kentucky, so Josephine and her mother typically lived in Franklin in the
winters and in Bowling Green in the summers.

Josephine Chanler contracted polio as a child and had surgery at various times
in her life as a consequence. She attended schools in both Franklin and Bowling
Green. She noted later that she started high school at age eleven in Franklin. At
about this time her mother was teaching history in a small college there, but was
unable to return to her job after an illness and surgery. Josephine Chanler then
attended a half year of high school in Bowling Green, before she and her mother
went to Jacksonville, Florida, to stay with family; she graduated in 1923, at age
seventeen, from Duval High School in Jacksonville.

Chanler credited her grandfather with starting to teach her mathematics at an
early age and her mother with encouraging her to go to college and later to do grad-
uate work. Thus, after her high school education they returned to Bowling Green
where she entered Western Kentucky State Normal School and Teachers College
(now Western Kentucky University). The college had awarded its ﬁrst degree (bac-
calaureate) in 1924. Chanler noted later that her tuition at Western Kentucky was
ten dollars a semester. She graduated in 1927 and that summer published a poem
in a journal of the Kentucky Folk-Lore Society. Immediately after her graduation,
she taught mathematics for two years in the high school in Bowling Green.

Chanler’s mother mortgaged the house she had inherited in Bowling Green, and
they moved to Illinois in 1929 so Josephine Chanler could begin her graduate work
at the University of Illinois. She was unable to get an assistantship the ﬁrst year
since her undergraduate degree was not from a fully accredited school. However,
she earned her master’s degree in 1930 with a thesis written under the direction
of Bessie Irving Miller, who had earned her PhD at Johns Hopkins University in
1914, one of the ﬁrst two doctoral students of Arthur B. Coble. Coble, who was to
become Chanler’s doctoral dissertation advisor, had come to Illinois as professor in
1918, while Miller had come as an instructor in 1928 after heading the mathematics
department at Rockford College in Illinois. Miller died suddenly a few months after
Chanler received her master’s degree. Chanler remained at Illinois and was a fellow
in mathematics 1930–31 and then an assistant in mathematics while ﬁnishing the
work for her doctorate in 1933 with a minor in physics. In the six years after she
received her PhD, Chanler published ﬁve papers in algebraic geometry.

Chanler remained at Illinois for the rest of her career, although she had an op-
portunity to take a position as assistant professor at a women’s college in New
England in the mid-1930s. She was assistant until 1937, instructor 1937–39, asso-
ciate 1939–45, assistant professor 1945–61, and associate professor 1961–71. When
Coble was on leave, Chanler was the dissertation director of one doctoral student,
Franz E. Hohn, who received his PhD in algebraic geometry in 1941. Chanler was
described by a former colleague, P. W. Ketchum, in 1983 as a “very ﬁne teacher.”
He also noted that she had many “subadministrative” jobs in the department.

In the summers during World War II, Chanler taught in programs for servicemen.
During the summers of 1959 through 1970 she was an instructor at National Science
Foundation institutes for high school teachers at Saint Louis University. In 1968 she
was among four University of Illinois faculty members to record a memorial tribute
to her advisor and colleague, Arthur Byron Coble. The tribute was reproduced in
the Bulletin of the AMS in 1970 (76:693–94).

Josephine Chanler and her mother lived together until her mother’s death in
1948. They shared an apartment for a year with Echo Pepper after Pepper’s apart-
ment mate, Bessie I. Miller, died. Pepper had joined the faculty at the University
of Illinois in 1928 as an instructor. Beulah Armstrong, who had earned her PhD at
Illinois twelve years before Chanler, was Chanler’s oﬃce mate for twenty years. Af-
ter the death of Chanler’s mother, Armstrong, who loved to drive, took Chanler on
trips nearly every summer; they camped in the West and went to various summer
mathematics meetings. Olive C. Hazlett was also a colleague for several years.

Chanler was a staunch Democrat and was a member of Toastmasters Interna-
tional. Her religious interests were serious and eclectic; in about 1940 she listed
her religion as Presbyterian; in a 1983 conversation with the author and Uta C.
Merzbach, she described herself as “a Southern Presbyterian–Calvinist–Catholic
with leanings toward Judaism and Islam and a very high regard for Buddhism,
Mormons, and some Hindu gods.” An obituary noted that she was a member of St.
Mary Catholic Church.

Chanler maintained an apartment in Champaign for many years after her retire-
ment. There she kept in touch with numerous former students and tutored without
charge countless students in mathematics. She was in a health care facility for about
ﬁve years before her death in Urbana at age eighty-six in 1992. She is buried in
Mount Hope Cemetery in Urbana.
