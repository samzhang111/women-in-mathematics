STOKES, Ruth W. October 12, 1890–August 27, 1968.
Winthrop Normal and Industrial College of South Carolina (BA 1911), Van-
derbilt University (MA 1923), Duke University (PhD 1931).

Ruth Wyckliﬀe Stokes was born in Greenville, South Carolina, the youngest of six
children of Frances Emily (Fuller) (1857–1915) and William Henry Stokes (b. 1850),
natives of South Carolina who married in 1879. In the 1880 census her father was
listed as an MD and a farmer; in 1900 he was listed as a farmer. Her older siblings
were John T. (1880–1963), Marie V. (1881–1957), Franklin F. (1883–1943), Sara
F. (1885–1977), and Clarence E. (1887–1941). In 1910, ﬁve of the adult children
were living at home with their widowed mother in Mountville, South Carolina. No
occupation was given for the nineteen-year-old Ruth, her sister Marie was a public
school teacher, two brothers were farmers, and one was at school. Although there is
conﬂicting information about the birth year for Ruth Stokes, census records indicate
that 1890 is the most likely date.

Stokes attended Winthrop Normal and Industrial College of South Carolina (af-
ter 1920, Winthrop College, the South Carolina College for Women; now Winthrop
University), then a women’s college in Rock Hill, South Carolina, for four years and
graduated in 1911. She had six teaching positions during the next dozen years. In
1911–12 she taught in grade school in Denmark, South Carolina; the next year she
taught high school mathematics, English, and French in the same town; in 1913–16
she was principal of the Ebenezer Graded School in Rock Hill, South Carolina; the
following year she was head of the mathematics department at Synodical College
in Fulton, Missouri; in 1917–20 she taught high school mathematics and English in
Spartanburg, South Carolina; and in 1920–22 she taught high school mathematics
in Greenville, South Carolina.

According to material in the Winthrop University Archives, Stokes indicated
in January 1922 that she had received certiﬁcates in mathematics and English
for work done at Columbia University (six weeks), the University of Virginia (six
weeks), and the University of Chicago (six weeks). She also did correspondence
work at the University of Chicago. Stokes held a fellowship at Vanderbilt 1922–23
and received her master’s degree in 1923. She spent the next ﬁve years as assistant
professor in a four-person mathematics department at Winthrop College. During
the summers of 1926, 1927, and 1928 she attended summer school at the University
of Wisconsin.

In the autumn of 1928 Stokes enrolled at Duke University, where she was a
graduate student and an assistant 1928–31. She received her PhD, the ﬁrst awarded
in mathematics by Duke, in 1931. Apparently at the time of her departure for Duke
for her doctoral work, Stokes felt that she had a private understanding with the
president of Winthrop that she would return to her position there after receiving
her degree. However, he died in 1928, and his replacement was not aware of such an
understanding. Thus, after Stokes received her degree in 1931, she did not return to
Winthrop but instead remained at Duke as an instructor 1931–32. In 1931 Stokes
published her dissertation in the Transactions of the AMS. Her dissertation results
were discussed in some detail in “Diﬀerent motivations and goals in the historical
development of the theory of systems of linear inequalities” by Tinne Hoﬀ Kjeldsen
(Arch. Hist. Exact Sci. 56 (2002): 469–538). He noted, “The innovative element in

Stokes’ contribution to the literature she is building on is the method she invoked
in developing the theory and the numerical solution method she derived” (p. 510).
The next three years, 1932–35, Stokes was an associate professor at North Texas
State Teachers College (now North Texas State University) in Denton. The fol-
lowing year she was professor and head of the department at Mitchell College in
Statesville, North Carolina. She also taught in the summer of 1936 at the Asheville
Normal and Teachers College in North Carolina. In the fall of 1936 Stokes returned
to Winthrop College, where she remained for most of the next ten years as profes-
sor of astronomy and mathematics and as department head. While there she was
active in a number of professional organizations and, in 1940, was a member of
the Solar Eclipse Expedition to St. Augustine, Florida. During the summer of 1941
Stokes attended the summer session at Brown University for advanced instruction
and research in mechanics. At some point in the period 1942 through 1946, dur-
ing and after World War II, she was an instructor of military cryptography and
cryptanalysis.

In the 1940s Stokes had disputes with the administration at Winthrop, partly
over issues of funding for the mathematics department. These resulted in her leaving
in 1946, when she joined the faculty at Syracuse University as assistant professor.
Nancy Cole became a colleague a year later. Stokes remained at Syracuse the rest
of her career. She held a dual position in mathematics and education in 1947–48
and was promoted to associate professor in 1953. Stokes was granted a year’s leave
of absence in 1956–57 to accept a visiting professorship at the American University
in Beirut. She returned home in December 1956 to be with her sister, Marie V.
Stokes, who was at that time in the Greenville, South Carolina, hospital. Marie
Stokes died the following August. Ruth Stokes retired from Syracuse as associate
professor emeritus in June 1959 after which she was associate professor, 1959–60,
at Longwood College (now Longwood University) in Farmville, Virginia.

Stokes was always professionally active. In the early 1940s she was vice-chairman
and then chairman of the Southeastern Section of the MAA, and she was president
of the mathematics section of the South Carolina Education Association. She was a
member of the board of directors of NCTM 1944–47 and was a member of their com-
mittee on visual aids. Stokes was particularly interested in mathematical models;
she gave a number of talks on this subject in the 1940s and exhibited a collection
of models at the International Congress of Mathematicians at Cambridge, Mas-
sachusetts, in 1950. While she was at Syracuse she was the ﬁrst editor-in-chief of
the Pi Mu Epsilon Journal , whose ﬁrst issue was November 1949 and whose par-
ent organization was founded at Syracuse in 1914. She belonged to the New York
Academy of Sciences, the South Carolina Academy of Science, and the Astronomical
Society of the Paciﬁc.

Stokes was also a member of Pi Lambda Theta, an honorary and professional
association in education; Chi Delta Phi, an honorary literary society; and Sigma
Kappa, a social sorority. Around 1940 she described herself as a Methodist and a
Democrat with art (oil paintings, ﬂorals, landscapes) as a hobby and golf as her
favorite recreation.

After her retirement, Stokes moved to her family home in Mountville, South
Carolina. She died at age seventy-seven in the hospital in nearby Clinton in 1968
and was buried in the Mountville Cemetery. An obituary noted that she was a
member of the Mountville Presbyterian church, the Daughters of the American

Revolution, and the National League of American Pen Women. She was survived
by one sister, Sara S. Hunter of Laurens, South Carolina.
