REKLIS, Virginia (Modesitt). June 15, 1910–November 29, 2000.
Mount Holyoke College (BA 1931), University of Illinois (MA 1932, PhD
1937).

Virginia Modesitt was born in Bloomington, Indiana, the only child of Floy
(Underwood) (1885–1984) and Raymond Lyons Modesitt (1883–1927). Both of her
parents were natives of central Indiana; her mother was born in Putnam County
and her father in neighboring Parke County. Both received bachelor’s degrees from
Indiana University in 1908; her father also earned a master’s degree from Indiana
the following year. They were married on August 17, 1909, and Virginia Modesitt
was born the following June. The 1910 census lists her father as a high school
teacher in Bloomington.

Raymond Modesitt became a teacher of mathematics at Eastern Illinois State
Normal School, in Charleston (later Eastern Illinois State Teachers College, now
Eastern Illinois University). He did additional graduate work in mathematics at
Columbia University in 1911 and at the University of Illinois in 1921. In 1913
R. L. Modesitt served as chairman of a committee of the mathematics section of
the University of Illinois High-School Conference that studied the establishment
of standards for high-school algebra; he later wrote an article for the Mathematics
Teacher on fundamental principles of algebra (15 (1922): 332–46). Virginia Modesitt
graduated from Eastern Illinois State Teachers College High School in 1927. Her
father died suddenly in December of that year, and she remained in Charleston and
attended the teachers college for a year before entering Mount Holyoke College in
September 1928. She had a major in mathematics and a minor in astronomy at
Mount Holyoke. She did honors work with Marie Litzinger, who had not yet earned
her doctorate, and all of her mathematics course work there was with Litzinger
and Emilie Norton Martin. Modesitt attended Butler University in Indianapolis,
Indiana, in the summer of 1930 and graduated from Mount Holyoke magna cum
laude in 1931. She also tutored during her senior year at Mount Holyoke.

In the fall of 1931 Modesitt entered the University of Illinois for graduate work.
She received her master’s degree the following year and stayed at Illinois until she
received her doctorate in 1937 with a minor in astronomy. Her dissertation in dif-
ferential geometry was directed by Harry Levy. In addition to her course work with
Levy, she later recalled and mentioned courses with R. D. Carmichael, A. B. Coble,
and A. R. Crathorne. She read history of mathematics with G. A. Miller and took
higher algebra with Olive C. Hazlett. While at Illinois she was a secretary in the
astronomy department 1933–34 and was an assistant in the mathematics depart-
ment 1934–37. In 1934 she published an article with a fellow graduate student, Ted
Martin (later chair of the mathematics department at MIT), in the Astrophysical
Journal.

After receiving her degree in 1937, Modesitt took a temporary instructorship at
Randolph-Macon Woman’s College in Virginia to substitute for someone on leave
of absence. Modesitt took more mathematics courses at the University of Michigan
during the summer of 1938. The position at Randolph-Macon was extended one
more year, but no position was available there in the fall of 1939 even though she
had enthusiastic support from Gillie Larew, the mathematics department chair at
Randolph-Macon.

In 1939 Modesitt moved to Chicago, where she was an instructor at Wright
Junior College for the next four years. She had learned of the job there through
Ruth Mason Ballard, with whom Modesitt had shared an oﬃce during 1936–37,
Modesitt’s last year at Illinois. Ruth Mason had been an instructor at Illinois before
moving to Wright Junior College in 1938. At Wright they worked together on the
development of survey courses for junior colleges, and both remained there until
1943, when Wright was taken over by the Navy as barracks and all the junior colleges
in the city were combined into one. While in Chicago Modesitt was a member of
the Women’s Math Club and presented a paper at one of the meetings.

On January 20, 1942, Virginia Modesitt married Ernest Peter Reklis, whom she
had met while both were students at the University of Illinois. Ernest Reklis, born
in Cicero, Illinois, in 1912, was an engineer who worked at Commonwealth Edison
in Chicago after receiving his BS in engineering from Illinois in 1939. He was in
the army from 1943 to 1945; they moved to the East, where both worked at the
Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. Virginia Reklis was ﬁrst a “computer”
and then a mathematician at the Ballistic Research Laboratories, Army Service
Forces, 1944–47. After the war Ernest Reklis remained at the Ballistic Research
Laboratories at the Aberdeen Proving Ground as an engineer working on supersonic
wind tunnels.

Their son, Robert Peter Reklis, was born in September 1947. He subsequently
earned a PhD in physics and is a research scientist in California. Virginia Reklis
did not seek employment while their son was young. However, she later was an
instructor of extension courses: for the University of Maryland at the Edgewood
Arsenal in Maryland 1960–65, and for the University of Delaware at the Aberdeen
Proving Ground 1962–66.

In her 1985 Smithsonian questionnaire, Virginia Reklis noted that she was brought
up in an academic community and that her father was an outstanding teacher of
mathematics. She described her religious preference as Presbyterian. She was a
member of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the P.E.O. Sisterhood, a
philanthropic educational organization. Beginning in 1967, Reklis published several
genealogies, some of which were coauthored with Helen Kurtz Wray. Virginia Rek-
lis’s husband died at age sixty-two in 1975; her mother died at ninety-nine in 1984.
In the middle 1980s Virginia Reklis lived in her mother’s former home in Danville,
Indiana. She later moved to California, closer to her son’s family.

Virginia Reklis died at Palo Alto Commons, an assisted living facility in Palo
Alto, California, in November 2000 at age ninety. She was survived by her son,
three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. A memorial service was held in
Danville, Indiana, and she was buried in the Danville South Cemetery.
