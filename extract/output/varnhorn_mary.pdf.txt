VARNHORN, Mary C. July 8, 1914–November 9, 1988.
College of Notre Dame of Maryland (BA 1936), Catholic University of Amer-
ica (MA 1937, PhD 1939).

Mary Catherine Varnhorn was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the daughter of Eleanor
(Levy) (b. 1889) and John Henry Varnhorn (1890–1978), natives of Maryland. At the
time of the 1920 census, she, her parents, and her brother, John, two years younger than
she, were living in Baltimore with her mother’s family. At that time her father was a
commercial traveler. Later they owned their own home in Baltimore, and her father was
described as a solicitor for a food company.

Mary Varnhorn did her undergraduate work at the College of Notre Dame of Maryland
in Baltimore, where she was a student of Sister Mary Cordia Karl. After her graduation in
1936 she began her graduate studies at the Catholic University of America in Washington,
D.C. She received her master’s degree in 1937 and her PhD in 1939, having written a
dissertation under the direction of Edward J. Finan, an assistant professor at the time. It
was read and approved by Aubrey E. Landry, soon to retire, and J. Nelson Rice.

Varnhorn returned to the College of Notre Dame of Maryland as instructor for the year
1939–40. She then joined the faculty at Trinity College in Washington, D.C., in 1940, six
years after the death of Sister Marie Cecilia Mangold, who had directed the department
for most of its previous history. When Varnhorn arrived at Trinity College (now called
Trinity Washington University), she joined Sister Thomas Marie (Catherine Maloney),
an associate professor who was studying for a PhD at Catholic, and Sister Mary Robert
(Grandﬁeld), who had joined the faculty the year Sister Marie Cecilia died. Sister Mary
Robert left in 1941, and Sister Thomas Marie died rather suddenly in the fall of 1943,
leaving the twenty-nine-year-old Mary Varnhorn alone in the department. At ﬁrst, some
courses were taught by Otto Ramler, professor at Catholic University, and then by various
others who ﬁlled in.

Varnhorn remained at Trinity for the rest of her career. She was instructor 1940–44,
assistant professor 1944–45, associate professor 1945–58, and professor 1958–78. From 1945
until her retirement, she was chairman of the department, which usually consisted of at
most three people. She initiated a number of curricular changes in the early 1960s and
was recognized especially for her commitment to teaching when she received, in 1965, the
Pro Ecclesia et Pontiﬁce Medal for twenty-ﬁve years of service at Trinity College.

Varnhorn maintained her residence in Baltimore throughout her life and commuted
into Washington. After her formal retirement in 1978 she taught two courses at Trinity
College as an adjunct in the fall of 1978–79, and she taught brieﬂy at Loyola College in
Baltimore and at the University of Baltimore. She was a member of the Duodecimal Society
of America (Dozenal Society of America since 1980), an organization for the conduct of
research and education in the use of the base twelve number system. Varnhorn was a
Democrat and a Roman Catholic. She was at one time president of the Mother Seton
Mission Crusade Unit, a group devoted to helping the needy.

Mary Varnhorn died at age seventy-four of a respiratory ailment at St. Agnes Hospital
in Baltimore in 1988. She was survived by her brother. A memorial liturgy was celebrated
at Trinity College on November 28, 1988.
