ROE, Josephine (Robinson). May 5, 1858–April 29, 1946.
Oberlin College (BA 1894), Dartmouth College (MA 1911), Syracuse Univer-
sity (PhD 1918).

Josephine Alberta Robinson was born in Meredith, New Hampshire, the daugh-
ter of Frances Eliza (Weld) (1831–1906), a native of Maine, and Joseph Wadleigh
Robinson (1817–1886) of New Hampshire, a farmer. The marriage in 1852 was
the second for her father. She had two older sisters and four younger brothers.
Her siblings were: Helen Augusta (1854–1932), Emma Jane (1856–1864), Francis
Joseph (1864–1935), Maurice Henry (1865–1946), Charles Frederick (1866–1932),
and George Washington (b. 1872). Her three youngest brothers all attended Dart-
mouth College; Maurice Henry and Charles Frederick graduated in 1890, and George
Washington transferred to Harvard after his sophomore year. Maurice Henry Robin-
son became an economist and spent most of his career at the University of Illinois
after earning a PhD from Yale in 1902. Charles Frederick Robinson became a Con-
gregational minister and, after his retirement, taught at Boston University. George
Washington Robinson became an author and was secretary of the Harvard Graduate
School of Arts and Sciences 1904–28.

Josephine Robinson did her secondary work at the New Hampton Literary In-
stitution, a few miles west of Meredith. She entered in November 1873, did the
English course, and graduated in 1880, having completed both the commercial and
the regular courses. She taught for more than a decade in New Hampshire schools
before entering college. Her early teaching positions included: teacher in New Hamp-
shire public district schools for about ﬁfteen months; principal of the high school in
Laconia 1880–82; and teacher, 1882–89, and preceptress, 1889–90, New Hampton
Literary Institution and Commercial College.

Robinson entered Oberlin College at age thirty-two in 1890 and graduated four
years later having done her major studies in mathematics. While at Oberlin, she was
a leading member of a literary society, and “. . . her productions were acknowledged
to be superior in thought and execution and in debate she was irresistible” (Berea
College Archives). She was also a member of the First Congregational Church in
Oberlin.

After graduating from Oberlin, Robinson was preceptress (instructor) at Kimball
Union Academy in Meriden, New Hampshire, 1894–97, where her main duty was
teaching Latin. She had been engaged in postgraduate work at Oberlin in Latin and
German education when she was “called” to Berea College in Kentucky in 1897.
Upon her arrival at Berea she taught Latin (Livy and Caesar), English literature,
and mathematics. At Berea she was principal of the Ladies Department and act-
ing professor of mathematics 1897–1901, dean of women 1901–07, and professor of
mathematics 1901–11. During her tenure at Berea, the mathematics courses oﬀered
by Robinson and her colleagues, all of whom were male, were Arithmetic I, II, III;
Algebra; Geometry; Trigonometry; Surveying; and Navigation. During the summers
of 1907 to 1910 she studied at Dartmouth College and received a master’s degree
in mathematics in June 1911.

On February 1, 1911, in Berea, Kentucky, Josephine Robinson married Edward
Drake Roe, Jr., a widower and mathematics professor at Syracuse University. E.
D. Roe was born in Elmira, New York, on January 4, 1859. He earned bachelor’s
degrees from Syracuse in 1880 and Harvard in 1885 and a master’s degree from

Harvard in 1886. He married Harriet Adelaide Bridge Gourley in 1890 and shortly
thereafter adopted her daughter, Mary Eva Gourley (b. 1879). After teaching at
Harvard and at Boston University, he went to Oberlin College as associate professor
of mathematics in 1892, when Josephine Robinson was in her third year there. He
was granted a leave 1897–99, studied at Erlangen 1897–98, and received a PhD from
there in 1898 having worked with Paul Gordan. His ﬁrst wife died in 1898, and he
remained on the faculty at Oberlin until the end of his leave in 1899. E. D. Roe was
on the faculty at Syracuse University from 1900 until his death twenty-nine years
later. In 1901 he was appointed to the John Raymond French chair of mathematics,
and in 1919 he was appointed director of the Holden Observatory at Syracuse; he
also served as head of the mathematics department. He built a private observatory
at his home and was the founder of the national honorary mathematics society Pi
Mu Epsilon in 1914.

After her marriage in February 1911, Josephine Robinson Roe left Berea College
and moved to Syracuse, where she subsequently engaged in graduate studies in
mathematics. In 1918, at age sixty, she received a PhD from Syracuse University
with a dissertation that she began with the statement: “This investigation is a
continuation of published work of Professor E.D. Roe, Jr., to whom I am greatly
indebted for assistance and advice.” She taught as assistant professor at Syracuse
in 1920; when she joined the MAA in 1934 she listed herself as assistant professor,
retired. E. D. Roe died suddenly from a heart attack at their home on December
11, 1929, less than a month before his seventy-ﬁrst birthday. In 1931 Josephine Roe
had her dissertation printed in two parts, the second of which reproduced tables
whose plates had been prepared by a student; the printed versions were referenced
in mathematical and statistical literature at least through 1961.

In response to an inquiry from Helen Owens, Roe wrote on her questionnaire
in 1940 that she was a Methodist and a Republican. She listed her honors as Phi
Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi, and Sigma Xi, and indicated that she was a fellow of
AAAS. She noted that she was a life member of the AMS and also of the Ameri-
can Astronomical Society. She wrote that she “assisted [her] husband somewhat in
his private Observatory in [their] residence. [She was] interested in birds and wild
ﬂowers, housekeeping, support of Christian missions at home and abroad, and of
temperance work. A lover of travels, a wide reader. Have been active in Daughters of
the American Revolution. Especially interested in people, just people, everywhere.
A ﬁrm believer in immortality.” Josephine Robinson Roe died in Newton Center,
Massachusetts, in April 1946, shortly before her eighty-eighth birthday.
Organizational aﬃliations: AMS, Amer. Astron. Soc., AAAS (fellow), Phi Beta Kappa,
Sigma Xi.
