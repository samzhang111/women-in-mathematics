MEARS, Florence M. May 18, 1896–December 3, 1995.
Goucher College (BA 1917), Cornell University (MA 1924, PhD 1927).

Florence Marie Mears was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the daughter of Flo-
rence Kate (Waidlich) (1867–1966) and Frank G. Mears (b. 1863), both natives of
Pennsylvania. Her mother attended college for one year, while her father had a high
school education; they married in 1895. Her father was manager of a farm imple-
ments store. Her twin brother, John W. Mears (1896–1988), was her only sibling.
His obituary notes that he was a retired railroad engineer, a WWI Navy veteran,
and retired from Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.

The Mears family lived in Baltimore while Florence Mears was growing up, and
it is likely that she attended elementary and high school in that city. She graduated
as a mathematics major from Goucher College in 1917. A letter of recommendation
written several years later indicates that she had assisted in the physical and chem-
ical laboratories at Eastern High School in Baltimore for ﬁve years, presumably
just after her graduation from Goucher.

Mears began her formal graduate studies during the summer of 1922, when she
studied invariants and covariants at the Johns Hopkins University. The following
summer she was at Cornell University, where she enrolled in a course in education
and courses in advanced calculus and advanced analytic geometry. She remained
at Cornell during the academic year 1923–24, taking four mathematics courses a
semester and earning her masters degree in June 1924.

Mears returned to Cornell in 1925 and received her doctorate in June 1927. She
held one of three graduate scholarships in mathematics 1925–26 and a fellowship her
last year. In addition to her work in analysis and geometry, she also took courses,
and minored, in physics. After receiving her PhD, Mears served for one year as
head of the department at Alabama College, then a women’s college and now the
coeducational University of Montevallo. She served as acting assistant professor at
Pennsylvania State College the following year, 1928–29.

In 1929 Mears began her career at George Washington University in Washington,
D.C., as an assistant professor. In 1930 she was living with her widowed mother
in nearby Bethesda, Maryland, where she continued to reside. She was promoted
to associate professor in 1936 and to professor in 1944. She continued her work in
the general area of her dissertation, the summability of divergent series. The most
frequently cited of her results appeared in 1937 in the Annals of Mathematics, soon
after her promotion to associate professor; this article continued to be cited for
more than ﬁfty years. Her last two research papers appeared after her promotion
to professor. Mears directed nine master’s theses between 1949 and 1964 and two
doctoral dissertations at George Washington. Her ﬁrst doctoral student, Joseph
Blum, received his degree in 1958, when Mears was sixty-two, and her second,
Janos Edvard Hanson, two years later. George Washington had awarded only four
doctorates in mathematics prior to these: two in the 1930s and two in the early
1950s.

In 1939 Mears was elected president of the George Washington University Faculty
Club; she was the ﬁrst woman elected to that oﬃce. The following year she served as
an oﬃcer of the local chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. She was active in the Maryland-
District of Columbia-Virginia Section of the MAA; she served as secretary of the

section 1949–50 and was on the executive committee 1951–52. Mears was also a
member of the Washington Academy of Sciences.

Mears retired from George Washington University as professor emeritus in June
1966. At that time the citation from the university president included the following:

The chairman of her department and the Dean of Columbian Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences have commended her for her excellence
as a teacher, her contributions to research, her vital contributions
to the Department of Mathematics, and for the esteem in which
her students hold her. In 1955 she received an Alumni Citation for
twenty-ﬁve years of distinguished service. In 1958 the University
of California selected her as one of ten women mathematicians as
consultants for a Mathematics Project for the study of creativity.
In 1962 she was a member of the Examining Committee for doc-
toral dissertations in mathematics for the University of Allahabad,
India. (George Washington University Archives)

After her retirement from George Washington, Mears was immediately hired by
Howard University, also in Washington, D.C., where she taught for another ten
years. After her second retirement, at age eighty, Mears remained in Bethesda,
Maryland, where “her interests included gardening, knitting, cross-stitching and
lace-making” according to an obituary in the Washington Post. “She became a
master weaver and was a member of the Potomac Craftsmen in Washington and
the Twenty Weavers.” In the late 1940s she had included “dogs” as one of her
hobbies. In 1949 an article in the George Washington University alumni magazine
noted her interest in growing roses and in Robin, her Dandie Dinmont terrier.

Florence Mears died at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda of heart disease at age

ninety-nine in 1995.
