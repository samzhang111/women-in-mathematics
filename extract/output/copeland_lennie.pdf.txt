COPELAND, Lennie P. March 30, 1881–January 11, 1951.
University of Maine (BS 1904), Wellesley College (MA 1911), University of
Pennsylvania (PhD 1913).

Lennie Phoebe Copeland was born in Brewer, Maine, the only child of Emma
(Stinchﬁeld) (b. 1851) and Lemuel Copeland (1845–1927), both natives of Maine.
Her parents married in 1867 and by 1900 were living in Bangor, Maine, where her
father was engaged in manufacturing.

Copeland graduated from the Bangor high school before going to the University
of Maine, from which she graduated in 1904. At the University of Maine, Copeland
was a member of Phi Kappa Phi, an honor society for scholarship; in 1921 she was
named an alumna member of Phi Beta Kappa at Maine. She also belonged to Alpha
Omicron Pi social sorority.

Copeland taught mathematics from 1905 to 1910 in the Bangor high school. She
then went to Wellesley College, where she earned a master’s degree in 1911. She
continued her graduate work at the University of Pennsylvania, where she was a
Bennett fellow and a Pepper fellow 1911–13. She received her doctorate in 1913
with a dissertation in invariant theory directed by Oliver E. Glenn, who had earned
a PhD from Pennsylvania in 1905.

Immediately after receiving her doctorate, Copeland was hired by Wellesley and
spent the rest of her career there. She was instructor 1913–20, assistant professor
1920–28, associate professor 1928–37, professor 1937–46, and professor emeritus af-
ter her retirement in 1946. Colleagues in the Wellesley mathematics department
included Helen Merrill, who was chair of the department 1916–32; Roxana Vivian;
Mabel Minerva Young; Clara Eliza Smith; Marion Stark; and Helen G. Russell. All
but Stark and Russell were on the Wellesley faculty when Copeland was a master’s
student there; Stark arrived in 1919 and Russell in 1928. Among Copeland’s teach-
ing responsibilities was a course she developed in the history of mathematics. In
connection with this interest she collected rare books, particularly on mathemati-
cal recreations, for the Treasure Room of the library. Copeland wrote a descriptive
catalogue of the rare mathematical books in the Wellesley library and spoke about
them several times to the Wellesley mathematics club.

Copeland’s appointments at Wellesley included terms on committees on long-
term educational policy; reappointments, promotions and dismissals; curriculum
and instruction; lectures, which she chaired; and the library. She spoke to Wellesley
clubs and to various professional associations. Copeland was one of the six members
of the Wellesley mathematics department who became members of the MAA before
April 1, 1916, and, hence, were charter members. She often attended the annual
and summer meetings of the association and served on the program committees for
the annual meetings of 1922 and 1923, chairing the latter. She was the ﬁrst woman
president of the New England Association of Teachers of Mathematics 1925–27.

In the late 1930s, Copeland described herself as a Republican and as Congrega-
tional. She was on the Service Fund of the Christian Association and was treasurer
at one time. Copeland’s many interests included attending plays, reading, driving,
hiking, and traveling. She was a member of the Appalachian Mountain Club and
served as a counselor in natural history for the club. Her travels included trips
to Europe 1930; Alaska 1931; Labrador 1934; Egypt, central Africa, and the Near
East 1935; Scandinavia 1936; Mexico 1937; and Puerto Rico 1939. The trip in 1935

lasted from mid-February until early June and was made with Clara Eliza Smith,
her close friend who had retired from the mathematics department at Wellesley the
summer before. It included Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Uganda, Turkey, Greece, and
Italy. In 1937, Copeland wrote to Helen Owens that she would be spending that
summer on “Miss Smith’s farm in the hills of Connecticut.” Smith died suddenly
of a cerebral hemorrhage in May 1943 in the home she shared with Copeland in
Wellesley. At the time of Copeland’s retirement three years later, it was noted in
the Wellesley alumnae magazine that “her friendship with Clara E. Smith, a former
member of our Mathematics Department, needs no elaboration to those who knew
them both. And the courage shown by Miss Copeland, when after Miss Smith’s
death she picked up the shattered plans of her life and rebuilt them beautifully, has
made a profound impression on all of us” (Wellesley College Archives).

Copeland was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by the University of
Maine in 1948. A February 1949 description of the occasion by Carol S. Scott (Mrs.
Wm. C. Scott), a mathematics instructor at St. Petersburg Junior College in Florida
who had graduated from Wellesley in 1911, noted that “the Maine citation especially
stressed her making mathematics ‘a joyous adventure’ to her years of classes but
after the speech she gave to the almost a thousand banqueting alumni the night
before commencement it could have lauded her ability to ‘steal the show’ from
formal lecturers” (Alumni Record Collection; Folder: Copeland, Lennie Phoebe;
University of Pennsylvania Archives).

Following her retirement from Wellesley, Copeland made her home in St. Peters-
burg with Carol Scott, whom she had known at Wellesley. Lennie Phoebe Copeland
died in St. Petersburg in January 1951 at age sixty-nine. The funeral was held in
St. Petersburg and was followed by burial in Brewer, Maine. She was survived by
several cousins.
