HUSTON, Antoinette (Killen). November 23, 1904–July 13, 1993.
University of Chicago (BS 1926, MS 1930, PhD 1934).

Antoinette Marie Killen was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Anna
(Harrold) (ca. 1876–1939) and Mark Henry Killen (1877–1945). Her parents were
born in Indiana. In 1910 they were living in Hyde Park in Chicago, and Mark
Killen was a groceries salesman. In 1930 the three were living in the Colonial Hotel
in Hyde Park, and her father was a lumber salesman. At the time of Anna Killen’s
death in May 1939, Mark Killen was described as treasurer of the Union Lumber
Company of Delaware, located in Chicago.

Antoinette Killen received her elementary and secondary education in the Chicago
public schools and graduated from Nicholas Senn High School on the north side of
Chicago in 1923. She later credited a “very inspiring high school teacher” with
enhancing her interest in mathematics (Smithsonian questionnaire 1985).

Killen entered the University of Chicago in the autumn of 1923. In a letter to
one of the authors that was postmarked March 9, 1978, she described aspects of
her university life.

All I ever wanted to be was a high school math teacher. But after
graduating from U of C in 1926 no such job opened up so I settled
for becoming librarian in charge of the math-physics-astronomy
library because Professor Moore wanted a librarian who knew a
number theory book from a trig. text. In about the same way I
advanced to become Prof. Bliss’s girl Friday – he wanted someone
who could spell “function” and other mathematical terms. I was a
self taught typist – and learned speedwriting in ﬁve weeks to be-
come his secretary. The job and life were pleasant. I took one course
at a time, played bridge, danced and dated graduate students, and
wrote a master’s thesis under Lawrence Murray Graves. . . . I really
did not dream of working toward the doctorate – but all of a sud-
den A. A. Albert told me I was going to work with him – he had
attended to all the preliminaries such as getting me admitted to
candidacy.

Killen had begun taking graduate courses in October 1927 and received her MS
in 1930. She earned her PhD in 1934, having also served as assistant secretary
to Gilbert Ames Bliss, who had become department chairman in 1928. While at
Chicago she studied with Professors A. A. Albert, G. A. Bliss, L. E. Dickson, L.
M. Graves, and Mayme Logsdon, among others; she was Albert’s ﬁrst doctoral stu-
dent. In her March 1978 letter she “list[s] among [her] good friends” the following
women who were mathematics graduate students at Chicago: Frances Baker, Julia
Wells Bower, Abba Newton, Mina Rees, Ruth Mason Ballard, Anne Staﬀord Hen-
riques, Emily Chandler Pixley, Beatrice L. Hagen, Aline Frink, and Virginia Haun
McShane.

Having just received her doctorate in June, on July 14, 1934, Antoinette Killen
married Ralph Ernest Huston, a fellow graduate student. Ralph Huston, born in
Huntington, Indiana, on September 16, 1902, graduated from the high school in Ke-
wanee, Illinois, and then from the University of Chicago in 1923, the year Antoinette
Killen entered. After graduating from Chicago, Huston was at Merton College, Ox-
ford, as a Rhodes scholar for three years, after which he earned a Bachelor of Arts

in the Final Honour School of English Language and Literature. The following year
he studied at the University of Grenoble. After returning to the United States in
1927, he was, for two years, associate professor of modern languages at Southwest-
ern (later Southwestern at Memphis) in Tennessee before entering the University of
Chicago for graduate study in mathematics in the summer of 1929. He earned his
PhD in 1932, having written his dissertation in number theory under the direction
of L. E. Dickson. Ralph Huston had also taught as a departmental assistant at
Chicago, as acting professor at Iowa State College, and in the Extension Division
of Indiana University in northwestern Indiana. In 1932–33 he was professor and
acting head of the department at Wesleyan College, a women’s college in Macon,
Georgia.

In 1934 Antoinette and Ralph Huston moved to Troy, New York, where Ralph
Huston began a thirty-three year association with Renssalaer Polytechnic Institute:
as instructor 1934–37, assistant professor 1937–43, associate professor 1943–48, pro-
fessor 1949–67, and professor emeritus after 1967. In her 1978 letter, Antoinette
Huston described her marriage as having launched her “on a new career– being a
wife and mother of Peter, Kenneth, Richard, and T. Michael Huston.” Their ﬁrst
child, Peter Eugene, was born on November 21, 1935; the second, Kenneth, on Feb-
ruary 17, 1937. The two younger boys were born within the next few years. She also
wrote that “when ‘baby’ Mike was able to make his own peanut butter sandwich
– in 1955 – [she] joined the math Dept at RPI as Assistant P.” She remained an
assistant professor until 1967, the year Ralph Huston retired, when she was pro-
moted to associate professor. Two years later, on October 8, 1969, Ralph Huston
died. Antoinette Huston retired as associate professor emeritus in 1970. The Ralph
Ernest Huston Prize was established in 1973 by Antoinette K. Huston and their
sons. It is awarded at commencement to the ﬁrst- or second-year graduate student
in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at RPI who has demonstrated unusual
promise and ability as a teacher.

Antoinette Huston assisted W. L. Duren, Jr., in the preparation of his article
“Graduate student at Chicago in the twenties” that appeared in the Monthly in
1976. She was active in the League of Women Voters and was a member of the
American Contract Bridge League. An avid duplicate bridge tournament player,
she reported in 1978 that she “liked to play ﬁve or six times a week, and spend any
spare moments reading books by bridge experts.” Huston moved to Santa Fe, New
Mexico, in the 1970s and died there in 1993 at age eighty-eight. She was survived
by her four sons, four grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. She was buried in
Huntington, Indiana, her husband’s birthplace.
