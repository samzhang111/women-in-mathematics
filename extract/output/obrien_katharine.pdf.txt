O’BRIEN, Katharine. April 10, 1901–April 10, 1998.
Bates College (BA 1922), Cornell University (MA 1924), Brown University
(PhD 1939).

Katharine Elizabeth O’Brien was born in Amesbury, Massachusetts, the younger
of two daughters of Catherine (Higgins) (1867–1947) and Martin William O’Brien
(1867–1944), both of whom had emigrated from Ireland about a decade before their
marriage in 1896. Her sister, Mary Ellen (1897–1974), was also born in Amesbury,
where in 1900 Martin O’Brien was a carriage painter. The family moved to Portland,
Maine, when Katharine was an infant. In 1910 her father was a painter in a carriage
factory; in 1920 he was an auto painter in a repair shop, and her sister was a
primary school teacher. For about the last twenty years of his life her father was
superintendent of the Songo River [Steamboat] Line when he and his wife lived in
Lake Sebago, Maine, in the summers.

Katharine O’Brien was the class valedictorian when she graduated from Deer-
ing High School in Portland at age seventeen. She then entered Bates College in
nearby Lewiston, Maine, and graduated from Bates in 1922 with double honors in
mathematics and science and with a minor each in the language and philosophy
groups.

O’Brien’s interests throughout her life focused on three areas: mathematics, mu-
sic, and poetry. In 1922–23, the year after her college graduation, she played piano
as an assistant in the department of hygiene and physical education at Smith Col-
lege. She also took a graduate course in music and one in English that year. When
O’Brien applied for admission to Cornell in May 1923, she asked about possible
assistantships in English or music. We do not know the outcome of that request,
but in 1923–24, she did graduate work in mathematics there and earned a master’s
degree in 1924 with a major in geometry and a minor in analysis, although she had
requested a minor in English.

From January to June 1925 O’Brien taught at Jordan High School in Lewiston,
Maine, and from 1925 until 1936 at the College of New Rochelle, a Catholic college
for women in New Rochelle, New York, that now admits men to schools other than
the original school of arts and sciences. At New Rochelle, O’Brien was instructor
1925–29 and professor and department head 1929–36. She was also a scholarship
participant in a master class in piano with Sigismond Stojowski in New York City
in 1934–35.

In 1936 O’Brien returned to graduate studies in mathematics at Brown Univer-
sity, where in 1937–38 she was a University scholar. She received her PhD in 1939
with a dissertation in analysis.

O’Brien joined the mathematics faculty of Deering High School in Portland,
Maine, in 1940. The ﬁrst ﬁve years there she was also director of the Girls’ Glee
Club. She became head of the mathematics department in 1945 and remained head
until her retirement in 1971. Although she seems to have been an extremely suc-
cessful teacher, it appears she sought other positions at least in the 1940s. In a
letter to R. G. D. Richardson of Brown on October 9, 1948, she wrote, “It seems
strange that there has been no teaching position for me in a New England college
in the nine years since I received the degree at Brown” (Correspondence 1947–1949,
R. G. D. Richardson Papers, Brown University Archives).

In 1962 O’Brien became a lecturer at Gorham State Teachers College (now the
University of Southern Maine). She continued lecturing there until 1973; during
that time the name of the college changed to Gorham State College, then Gorham
State College of the University of Maine, and, in 1970, to the University of Maine at
Portland-Gorham. She was also a lecturer in NSF institutes for teachers at Brown
in summers 1962–65 and 1967.

O’Brien’s many professional and extracurricular activities included serving as the
Maine representative to NCTM 1951–56, refereeing for the NCTM journal Mathe-
matics Teacher for more than thirty years (1953–84), and participating in activities
of the NCTM aﬃliate, the Association of Teachers of Mathematics in New England
(ATMNE). During the 1950s she gave talks to both of these groups and served on a
panel, “The Gifted Student,” at a meeting of the National Education Association.
During the summer of 1951 she helped to run an ATMNE-sponsored institute for
teachers of mathematics at Connecticut College. She was governor for the north-
eastern region of the United States of Mu Alpha Theta, the high school and junior
college mathematics club, 1962–65, and was a member of the New York Academy
of Sciences. O’Brien published poetry and light verse in magazines and newspa-
pers, including the Saturday Review, Christian Science Monitor, New York Herald
Tribune, New York Times, Ladies Home Journal, and Scientiﬁc Monthly. She also
wrote mathematical poems, many of which appeared in professional journals; por-
tions of two of those poems, 1968 and 1982a, were reprinted in a dictionary of
mathematical quotations. In 2008 two poems, “Undeﬁned Terms” and “Valentine,”
from O’Brien’s collection 1967 were reprinted in the anthology Strange Attractors:
Poems of Love and Mathematics (Natick, MA: A. K. Peters). She was a member of
the International Platform Association, dedicated to public speaking and perform-
ing, and the Poetry Society of America. She also composed music and published
choral octavos using the words of Thomas Hardy. Finally, she was a member of
Bates Key, the Portland College Club, and the Society of Bowdoin Women.

O’Brien was recognized in a number of ways for her contributions to mathemat-
ics, poetry, and music. In 1960 the University of Maine awarded her an honorary
Doctor of Science in Education degree, and in 1965 Bowdoin College gave her an
honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree. The Dr. Katharine E. O’Brien math-
ematics award to be given annually to a senior at Deering High School was estab-
lished by the Deering class of 1964. In 1985 Westbrook College, which later merged
with the University of New England, gave O’Brien the Deborah Morton Award, an
annual award in Maine honoring women’s achievement.

Katharine O’Brien died on her ninety-seventh birthday at a nursing home in Fal-
mouth, Maine, after a lengthy illness. A funeral Mass was celebrated at St. Joseph’s
Church, and she was buried in St. Joseph’s Cemetery in Amesbury, Massachusetts.
After her death, the University of Maine System received a gift of $400,000 from her
estate in support of its library holdings. In particular, each of the seven universities
in the system was to create one or two specialized named library collections. While
almost all of the schools choose to honor O’Brien with poetry collections, other areas
covered are literature, women’s and ethnic studies, mathematics, computer science,
environmental studies, forestry, nursing, secondary education, and children’s liter-
ature. A bequest of a comparable size was made to Bowdoin College, a portion of
which was earmarked for the library. Her papers, including photographs, are housed
in the Maine Women Writers Collection, University of New England Libraries.
