Andrewa Rebecca Noble was the second of four children of Grace (Marshall)
(1878–1922) and Emory James Noble (1880–1959). Her parents were born in the
Portland, Oregon, area: her father in Oregon City and her mother in Portland;
they married in 1903. Her mother attended high school in Portland and later was
a teacher and a housewife. Her father had an LLB degree from the University of
Oregon and was an attorney. Andrewa Noble and her siblings were born in Oregon
City and all attended college. The eldest, Louise (1906–1995), was a teacher and
housewife; John Wesley (1913–1975) was a newspaperman and professional writer;
and Inez (1916–1994) was a stenographer and housewife and served in the Women’s
Army Corps in World War II.

Andrewa Noble attended public elementary school 1913–21 and high school 1921–
25 in Oregon City. At graduation she received an honor scholarship to Paciﬁc Uni-
versity in Forest Grove, Oregon. Four years later she graduated from Paciﬁc magna
cum laude. While at Paciﬁc, she was involved with the drama club; was a member
of the Women’s Athletic Association; and played soccer, basketball, and volley-
ball. She was a member of Alpha Kappa Delta, a local sorority, and worked on the
university’s yearbook. She was active in the debate club and earned the Witham
debate cup her junior year. In her senior year she was the vice president of ASPU,
the student association, and was editor of The Index, the college newspaper. She
served as the permanent secretary of her graduating class of 1929. The year follow-
ing her graduation she was vice president of the alumni council and was living in
Gladstone, Oregon.

In 1930 Noble became a high school teacher in Tosten, Montana, and taught
there until 1932. She was a graduate student at the University of California 1933–
35. While in Berkeley she earned a master’s degree in 1934 and a doctorate in 1935.
She studied, among other subjects, logic with A. B. Bernstein, projective diﬀeren-
tial geometry with Pauline Sperry, and number theory with D. N. Lehmer, who
directed her dissertation in that area. She became a life member of the University
of California’s alumni association.

During 1935–36 Noble was a teacher in Colstrip, Montana, and the following
year she was superintendent of schools there. She taught in a high school in the
state of Washington 1937–38. In 1940 Noble became an instructor at San Francisco
Junior College and stayed in that position until 1945, serving as coordinator of the
remedial arithmetic program from 1942. She was appointed instructor at Montana
State University (now University of Montana) in Missoula sometime before July
1946 and spent the academic year 1946–47 as an assistant professor there.

In 1947 Noble returned to her alma mater, Paciﬁc University, and was an as-
sociate professor and secretary of the faculty for two years. It appears she then
lived with her brother in Oakland, California, for some time before joining the fac-
ulty at Mills College in 1952. From 1952 until 1957 she was assistant professor of
mathematics and physics and head of the department at Mills, a women’s college
in Oakland. From 1957 to 1959 she was assistant professor at Chico State College
before returning to Paciﬁc University, where she was to teach the last eight years
of her career. She was associate professor 1959–1961 and professor from 1961 until
her retirement in 1965. She also served as chairman of the department at Paciﬁc.

In the 1960s she served as chairman of the chemistry, physics, and mathematics
section of the Northwest Scientiﬁc Association.

Noble belonged to the Protestant Episcopal Church and maintained a life mem-
bership in the Townsend, Montana, Order of the Eastern Star. While in college she
served on the Hoover for President Commission. She was a Republican and served
as precinct committeewoman in Forest Grove in the 1960s. She served as the of-
ﬁcial scorer of the Paciﬁc University basketball team 1962–63 and counted stamp
collecting among her hobbies.

After her retirement, Noble lived for a number of years in Auburn, California,
and in Forest Grove, Oregon, alternating between them every few years, according
to combined membership lists of the professional mathematics organizations. In the
last half of the 1980s she was living in Forest Grove and in the 1990s in Auburn. She
