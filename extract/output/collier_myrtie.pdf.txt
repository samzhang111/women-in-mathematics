COLLIER, Myrtie. September 14, 1877–June 25, 1974.
University of Chicago (BS 1911), Universit´e de Strasbourg (PhD 1930).

Myrtie Collier was born in Carthage, Missouri, the third of four children of
Angeline (Willson) (b. 1839), of Kentucky, and Ervin Collier (b. 1832), a farmer,
originally from Indiana. According to the 1880 and 1900 census records, her parents
married in about 1871 and had two sons, Erwin (b. ca. 1873) and Ellis (b. 1875),
and two daughters, Myrtie and Josie (b. 1880), all born in Missouri. The household
in 1880 also included two daughters of her father, Wenona and Mary, ages nineteen
and seventeen, born in Kansas, presumably from an earlier marriage. Myrtie Collier
and her younger sister were both listed as teachers in the 1900 census.

After obtaining her bachelor’s degree at age thirty-three in 1911 from the Uni-
versity of Chicago, Collier moved to California to become a mathematics teacher
and chairman of the department at the Los Angeles State Normal School, prede-
cessor of the University of California, Los Angeles. The State Normal School was
established in 1881; in 1919 it oﬀered its ﬁrst instruction at the postsecondary level
and became the Southern Branch, University of California, a two-year institution.
It added a four-year teachers’ curriculum in 1922, a four-year letters and science
curriculum in 1923, and awarded its ﬁrst bachelor’s degree in 1923. While teaching
at the Normal School, Collier was doing educational experiments and publishing
articles in the journal School Science and Mathematics. She published one more
article in this journal after she received her PhD in 1930.

Collier remained at the Southern Branch of the University of California as chair-
man of the department through 1920 and as assistant professor from 1920 until
1928, a year after the school’s name changed to the University of California at Los
Angeles. She took a year’s leave of absence 1920–21 and was for some time in 1920
an associate in the mathematics department at the University of Chicago. While
there she was a member of the program committee for the junior mathematical
club at the university for 1920–21. In 1928 she left UCLA to pursue further grad-
uate study and received her PhD cum laude from the University of Strasbourg in
1930, when she was ﬁfty-two. She returned to Los Angeles, where she served as
department chairman at Immaculate Heart College (now closed) from 1930 until
her retirement in 1947 as professor emeritus. Upon her retirement, the students of
the mathematics study club at Immaculate Heart honored her with a dinner for her
successful service with the college. While at Immaculate Heart she often attended
meetings of the AMS held in the Los Angeles area.

Collier was, by her own account, a great traveler. In addition to other trips, she
was in Europe in summer 1937. She considered herself a student of the history of
science and anthropology, and she enjoyed music. She was a Presbyterian.

Myrtie Collier maintained her residence in Los Angeles until her death of pneu-
monia as a consequence of left ventricular failure and longer term heart problems.
She died in Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles at age ninety-six in 1974 and
was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in Glendale, California.
Organizational aﬃliations: AMS, MAA (charter member), AAAS (fellow), Pi Mu Ep-
silon.
