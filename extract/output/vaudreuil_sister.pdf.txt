VAUDREUIL, Sister Mary Felice. August 20, 1894–October 27, 1978.
DePaul University (BA 1921), Catholic University of America (PhD 1931).

Annette Vaudreuil was born in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, the eldest of ﬁve children of
Lenora (Blair) (1871–1905) and Ludger J. Vaudreuil (1866–1943). Her mother was born
in Wisconsin; her father was born near Qu´ebec City in Canada and moved to Wisconsin
as a boy. Later he was a lumber merchant in Chippewa Falls. Annette Vaudreuil was ten
when her mother died in 1905, and the youngest of the ﬁve children was two years old.
Her siblings were Fred L. (b. ca. 1897), Irene (b. ca. 1899), Lionel H. (ca. 1901–1959),
and Roland Cecil (1903–1996). Her sister, Irene, became a nurse, and her brother Lionel
attended the University of Wisconsin. Her father married Marie Caron, a dressmaker, in
1907. Five of six children born of this second marriage lived to maturity.

From the time she was about school age, Annette Vaudreuil’s family lived two blocks
from the Notre Dame convent, school, and church in Chippewa Falls. She attended the
grade school and high school there. She entered the Congregation of the School Sisters
of Notre Dame after her graduation from McDonell Memorial High School in 1911, was
received in 1913, and took ﬁrst vows in 1915 and ﬁnal vows in 1921.

As a novice Sister Mary Felice Vaudreuil was sent to teach in the high school in Es-
canaba, Michigan. After profession in 1915 she returned to Escanaba but, after one week
of teaching, was recalled and sent to teach at the Academy of Our Lady in the Longwood
area of Chicago. In October 1915 she enrolled at DePaul University in Chicago. By taking
courses that met in the late afternoons, Saturdays, or in the summers, she was able to
teach and complete the work for her bachelor’s degree, which she received in August 1921.
She then took graduate courses in the autumn-winter session at DePaul in French, Latin,
and philosophy in 1921–22, and in philosophy, education, and mathematics in 1922–23.
She also did graduate work at Creighton University in Nebraska, Marquette University in
Wisconsin, and Loyola University of Chicago, presumably in the summers.

Sister Felice taught at the Academy of Our Lady until 1925, when she was transferred
to St. Mary’s College in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. In 1928 she was one of the ﬁrst two
at St. Mary’s to be given a sabbatical leave for full-time study. She entered the Catholic
University of America in Washington, D.C., and was in residence there from 1928 until
she completed her work for the PhD in 1931 with a dissertation in algebraic geometry and
minors in education and physics.

After receiving her doctorate, Sister Felice returned to Mount Mary College in Milwau-
kee, the successor to St. Mary’s in Prairie du Chien. She taught mathematics, meteorology,
and astronomy and was chairman of the mathematics department. She was lecturer for the
graduate school at Loyola University in Chicago for three or four years in the mid-1930s
and taught some graduate courses at Marquette University in Milwaukee. Under her direc-
tion, a chapter of Kappa Mu Epsilon was established on the Mount Mary campus in 1947,
and she served as faculty advisor for many years; each spring the members sponsored a
mathematics contest for senior girls and boys in the area. Furthermore, she was active in
many state and national professional organizations. She was chairman of the Wisconsin
Section of the MAA 1939–40 and 1945–46 and was secretary-treasurer 1953–60; she served
on the national MAA Committee on High School Contests 1957–62. At the state level, she
was a member of the Wisconsin Education Association and of the Wisconsin Mathematics
Council for which she was vice president 1951–52 and president 1952. In 1960 she was a
participant in a conference of the Wisconsin State Committee of the North Central As-
sociation on problems in articulating mathematics instruction in high school and college.
That year she also served as a representative of the AAAS at the annual meeting of the
National Commission on Teacher Education and Professional Standards (TEPS) in San
Diego.

Among Sister Felice’s many notable interests were astronomy and meteorology. She
had a three-inch French refractor telescope available for her astronomy classes and was a
member of the Milwaukee Astronomical Society. In 1966 she was awarded a pin by the US
government for twenty years of volunteer service to the US Weather Bureau as a weather
observer. She was also a member of the National Geographic Society.

Sister Felice was described by a colleague as an “excellent French cook, . . . a lover of
classical music, and especially opera, which she listened to on the radio Saturday after-
noons, libretto in hand; . . . she loved art and took courses in design in her latter teaching
years” (Mount Mary College Archives). She was a bird watcher who kept feeding stations
on the campus and was also described as a linguist, philosopher, seamstress, and bridge
player.

Sister Felice retired to the motherhouse in Mequon from Mount Mary College in 1967.
Hearing of the need for a mathematics teacher in a nearby college, she taught a course
there for a few years. After her retirement she also studied to be a ham radio operator
and was able to contact Guam and other locations where there were missionary sisters.

In 1972 Sister Mary Felice Vaudreuil entered the Notre Dame Health Care Center in

Elm Grove, Wisconsin, and died there six years later at age eighty-four.
