Catholic University of America (Catholic Sisters College) (BA 1927), Catholic
University of America (MA 1935, PhD 1938).

Josephine Fowler was born in Mechanicsville, Maryland, the eldest of eleven
children of Charlotte (Burch) (1879–1975) and Thomas Henry Fowler (1854–1920),
natives of Maryland. Her parents married in 1898; it was a second marriage for
her father who had four children by his previous marriage. He was a merchant and
later a farmer. Her siblings were Ann Elizabeth (1900–1991), Mary Rebecca (1903–
1991), Charles Burch (1906–1991), Joseph Alfred (1908–1977), Charlotte Turner
(1910–2002), Dorothy D. (1912–1986), Ernest deSales (1914–1915), Mary Walter
(1916–2000), Mary Rita (1918–1918), and Mary Jane (b. 1920).

Josephine Fowler attended public school until 1916 and then attended St. Mary’s
Academy in Leonardtown, Maryland, 1916–18. Upon graduation she was awarded
the gold medal for mathematics. On September 24, 1918, she entered the novitiate
of the Congregation of the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth, in Nazareth, Kentucky,
and took the religious name Sister Mary Charlotte Fowler.

Sister Mary Charlotte taught religion, mathematics, physics, English, and history
primarily in high schools from 1920 to 1933. In the same period she was doing course
work, including ﬁve summers at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, where
she took courses in Latin, English, art, and education, as well as correspondence
courses in trigonometry and American literature. She also studied one summer at
Notre Dame University where she took courses in statistics and modern algebra.
Her ﬁrst teaching assignment was at St. Vincent’s Academy in Union County, Ken-
tucky, 1920–21. Others were in Henderson, Kentucky, 1921–23 and in Yazoo City,
Mississippi, 1923–26.

Fowler was in residence as a student at Catholic Sisters College of the Catholic
University of America 1926–27 and received her bachelor’s degree in 1927. She then
taught in a high school in Mt. Vernon, Ohio, 1930–32 and in summer school at
Nazareth Junior College in Kentucky in the summers 1927–30.

Sister Mary Charlotte was an assistant instructor in mathematics at Nazareth
College in Nazareth, Kentucky, 1932–33 after which she was on leave for study at
Catholic University. She was in residence at Catholic from 1933 until 1937 and
earned her master’s degree in 1935. When she left Catholic in 1937 she began
teaching mathematics and physics at the Nazareth College campus in Louisville,
Kentucky. The next year, 1938, she received her PhD with minors in physics and
education, having written a dissertation in algebraic geometry under the direction
of Aubrey Landry.

Nazareth College in Louisville was established in 1920 as a branch of Nazareth
Academy in Nazareth. When Sister Mary Charlotte began teaching at Nazareth
College in Louisville, she joined Sister Charles Mary Morrison who had come in
1931 and who was at various times head of the department, registrar, and dean of
the college. Sister Mary Charlotte Fowler was professor of mathematics and physics
until her retirement from the college in 1969. She was chairman of the department
from 1950 until she was appointed president of the college in 1961. She taught some
after she became president until her administrative duties became too great.

When Sister Mary Charlotte Fowler became president of Nazareth College in
Louisville in 1961, the two campuses at Louisville and Nazareth became two distinct

colleges. In 1963 the name of the college in Louisville was changed to Catherine
Spalding College to distinguish it from the college in Nazareth. In 1969, when
Sister Mary Charlotte’s tenure as president ended, the college in Louisville merged
with the one in Nazareth, became coeducational, and adopted the name Spalding
College (now Spalding University).

Fowler is credited with many positive changes and innovations while president
of the college. These included overseeing a period of growth of about ﬁfty percent
in the student population and conducting the ﬁrst capital campaign in the college’s
history. Graduate programs were added, and science, library, and dormitory build-
ings were constructed. The Fowler Fellowships, which allowed anyone sixty-ﬁve or
older to take classes tuition-free, were created as was the Center for Continuing
Education for the non-traditional student.

Sister Mary Charlotte was active in the community and was inducted into the
Honorable Order of the Kentucky Colonels in 1967. She was a member of the
Kentucky Academy of Science. In 1992 she described her political aﬃliation as
Democrat. Among hobbies she enjoyed were reading, crafts, photography, stamp
collecting, collection of unusual recipes, and weaving, which continued well into
her retirement. She also was a member of the American Association of Physics
Teachers.

In the early 1970s, she was living in St. Vincent’s Home, an orphanage for boys,
in Roanoke, Virginia. At some point, after the orphanage disbanded in 1975, she
was living at the Motherhouse in Nazareth, Kentucky. Sister Mary Charlotte died
on her ninety-eighth birthday in the Nazareth Home in Louisville, Kentucky, in
1997. She was survived by three sisters and a half-sister, and she was buried in the
Nazareth Motherhouse Cemetery.
