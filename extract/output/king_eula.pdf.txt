KING, Eula (Weeks). September 13, 1882–June 30, 1967.
University of Missouri (BA 1908, BS 1908, MA 1909, PhD 1915).

Eula Adeline Weeks was born near Louisville, Georgia, the third of ﬁve children
of Luella Vienna (Tarver) (1860–1935) and Caleb Garvin Weeks (1850–1914). Her
parents, natives of Georgia, married in about 1878. Her older brothers, William
Brinson (1879–1914) and Julian Charles (1880–1951), were born in Georgia; her
younger sisters, Clara Belle (1887–1914) and Alice Elizabeth (1900–1991), were
born in Missouri. Her father was successively a bookkeeper, a bank clerk, and later
a county court clerk.

In 1900 and 1910 her family lived in Bates County, Missouri, near the Kansas
border. Weeks was a teacher in the high school in Rich Hill, Missouri, from 1901 to
1907. In 1908, at age twenty-ﬁve, she received both a BA and a BS in education,
and was valedictorian of the class of 1908 in the College of Arts and Science at the
University of Missouri. The next year she was a university fellow in mathematics
and in 1909 received a master’s degree from Missouri.

Eula Weeks then went to Bryn Mawr College, where she was a fellow in mathe-
matics 1909–10 and a fellow by courtesy 1910–11. Her occupation is listed as teacher
in a preparatory school in the 1910 census, as well. The journal club at Bryn Mawr
did not hold meetings 1909–10, but her presentations are recorded for 1910–11,
when she spoke on the solution of numerical equations, and for 1911–12, when she
presented papers on the group of homographic substitutions and on general analytic
methods of solutions of transcendental equations.

After three years at Bryn Mawr, Weeks returned to Missouri, where she held a
university fellowship 1914–15 and received her PhD in 1915. She was one of two
students whose work was directed by E. R. Hedrick at the University of Missouri.
In addition to his many research, editorial, and administrative activities, Hedrick
became the ﬁrst president of the MAA in 1916 and was especially involved with
reforms in secondary mathematics teaching. Eula Weeks was a charter member of
the MAA.

In 1916 Eula A. Weeks was a teacher at Grover Cleveland High School in St.
Louis. By 1919 she had been appointed to the National Committee on Mathematical
Requirements as one of three secondary school representatives. The committee was
ﬁrst appointed in 1916 by Hedrick as president of the MAA and was chaired by J. W.
Young of Dartmouth; Weeks served on a subcommittee to report on elective courses
in secondary schools. A preliminary report of the committee, issued as Secondary
School Circular No. 5 by the US Bureau of Education, appeared in 1920. The ﬁnal
report of the committee was published by the MAA in 1923, and parts of it were
reprinted by Houghton Miﬄin in 1927. Weeks gave several talks about the reports
at meetings of the MAA. During this period Weeks continued teaching at Cleveland
High School and was active in organizations for mathematics teachers. In 1920 she
was elected secretary of the mathematics section of the Missouri Society of Science
and Mathematics Teachers, and she served as vice president of the NCTM 1922–23
and on the NCTM board of directors 1923–26.

Eula Weeks married Harry Lane King (1885–1966) on June 15, 1924, in St. Louis.
Harry King was born in Topeka, Kansas, and was a high school teacher in St. Louis.
At least in the mid-1940s he was a teacher in the industrial arts department at
Grover Cleveland High School.

KING - 2

Eula Weeks King stopped teaching after she married, although she maintained
her membership in the MAA until about 1940. The Kings had two children, Harry
L. King Jr., born in 1925, and Mary Adeline, born in 1927. Their son became a
civil engineer and died in 1973.

After her husband’s death in 1966, King maintained the same residence in St.
Louis she had had since at least 1930. She went to her son’s home in Inglewood,
California, about a month before her death there of a myocardial infarction at age
eighty-four in June 1967.
