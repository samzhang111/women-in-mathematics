MADDISON, Isabel. April 13, 1869–October 22, 1950.
University of London (BSc 1893), Bryn Mawr College (PhD 1896), Trinity
College (Dublin) (BA 1905).

Ada Isabel Maddison was born in Whitehaven, a seaport town in Cumberland,
the most northwestern county in England. She was the daughter of Mary Jane
(Anderson), born in about 1829 in Ireland, and John Maddison, born in about
1826 in Durham, England. Her father was a civil servant. British census records
indicate that Isabel Maddison was probably the youngest of four children. The
others were Anne (b. 1853), Jane (b. 1854), and William Thomas (b. ca. 1859). In
1871 the family was living in Whitehaven, where it appears that John Maddison was
a parish supervisor, and in 1881 they were in Cardiﬀ, Wales, where her father was
an internal revenue collector. In 1891 Isabel Maddison and her sister Annie were in
Bristol, England, with their brother, William T., a registered medical practitioner.
After attending Miss Tallies School in Cardiﬀ, in June 1885 Isabel Maddison
passed the matriculation examination at the University of London (an examin-
ing body only and not a teaching institution at that time). She then entered the
University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire in Cardiﬀ and passed the
University of London intermediate science examination in 1887. She remained until
1889 but did not earn a degree from University College, Cardiﬀ, since it did not
grant degrees at that time.

In 1889 Maddison went to Girton College in Cambridge on a scholarship given
by the Clothworkers’ Guild. With another ﬁrst-year student, Grace Chisholm, she
obtained permission to sit in on Arthur Cayley’s lectures at Cambridge. In the be-
ginning, her tutor at Girton was William Henry Young, who would marry Grace
Chisholm in 1896. Chisholm later wrote that for Maddison “a high place in Tripos
was worth ‘bread and butter and dresses and hats’ ” (Grattan-Guinness 1972, 118).
Thus, Chisholm, who believed her own tutor, Arthur Berry, superior to Young, con-
vinced Maddison to share her tutorial the following year. Maddison and Chisholm
took all their examinations at the same time; Maddison scored slightly better than
Chisholm the ﬁrst two years. At the end of the third year when they sat for Part I
of the Tripos in spring 1892, their placement was reversed; both earned ﬁrst class
with Maddison equal to the twenty-seventh Wrangler. They both then unoﬃcially
sat for the Oxford Final Honours School in mathematics, the ﬁrst women to do so.
Chisholm remained another year at Girton and then went to G¨ottingen to become,
with Mary Winston (Newson), one of the ﬁrst three women to formally attend
lectures and participate in the seminars there.

In 1892 Isabel Maddison came to Bryn Mawr College as a graduate student
where she studied mathematics and practical physics. During that year she did
work in singular solutions of diﬀerential equations and in 1893 published a paper
in the British Quarterly Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics on families of
curves. Also in 1893, the University of London conferred a BSc with honours on her.
According to the college archivist of Imperial College, London, she was “joint second
highest in maths for that year [and] tuition was from University College Cardiﬀ,
Girton (Cambridge), and Bryn Mawr. . . .” During 1893–94, her second year at Bryn
Mawr, she was a fellow in mathematics, and in April 1894 was awarded Bryn Mawr’s
ﬁrst Mary E. Garrett European fellowship. Charlotte A. Scott, in writing to Felix

Klein asking that Maddison be admitted to the university at G¨ottingen, referred to
her as “one of my best students.” She also remarked, “When she ﬁrst came to Bryn
Mawr, she was, in my opinion, suﬀering from the eﬀects of overtraining during her
seven years of undergraduate life . . . . But her mind soon recovered its elasticity, and
my opinion of her ability has increased steadily” (Universit¨atsarchiv G¨ottingen).

Maddison spent the year 1894–95 in G¨ottingen studying with Klein and David
Hilbert, among others. The following year she was assistant secretary to M. Carey
Thomas, the president of Bryn Mawr. At the end of that year she was awarded her
PhD with a dissertation written under the direction of Scott in the area she ﬁrst
studied at Bryn Mawr, singular solutions of diﬀerential equations. For her doctorate
she was examined in the ﬁelds of pure and applied mathematics and in physics.
During the year 1895–96 Maddison prepared a translation of an 1895 address by
Felix Klein to the Royal Academy of Sciences of G¨ottingen, which appeared in the
Bulletin of the AMS.

From 1896 to 1904 Maddison served as secretary to President Thomas and as
reader in mathematics. In 1904 her administrative position changed to assistant
to the president, while in 1906 her departmental position changed to associate
in mathematics. She remained in her dual departmental, administrative positions
until 1910 at which time she became recording dean and assistant to the president,
remaining in these positions until she retired in 1926. For at least a short period of
time, Maddison lived with Charlotte Scott and Scott’s cousin.

Although Maddison remained at Bryn Mawr her entire career, the only time she
was an active participant in the Bryn Mawr Mathematics Journal Club that started
in 1896 was during its ﬁrst year when she spoke on “Curves which cover an area
of the plane.” During her years as secretary to the president, Maddison compiled
information for handbooks of universities open to women and for a statistical study
of women college graduates. She also is listed as author on several Bryn Mawr
alumnae registers. Soon after receiving her doctorate she published a number of
book reviews in the Bulletin of the AMS as well as a short note on the history of
map-coloring problems.

According to the Bryn Mawr alumnae oﬃce, “in 1905 [Maddison] obtained leave
to study at Trinity College, Dublin, where she received a B.A. degree” (Williams
Papers). The University of Dublin, as it was also called, does not have a record of
her studying there. According to the university’s information oﬃce, Maddison “had
the B.A. degree conferred on her by this University in 1905. She did not, however,
study at the University but had completed the necessary exercises at the University
of Cambridge to entitle her to have this degree conferred” (Williams Papers).

Isabel Maddison lived in Bryn Mawr most of the time she was associated with
the college. She made a trip to England nearly every summer. During World War
I, she contributed to the war eﬀort. One summer she did secretarial work for the
Woman’s Committee of National Defense; another summer she did statistical work
for the American Shipping Board. She and her older sister Janie sailed from Eng-
land to New York in September 1925, before her retirement in 1926. At that time,
she indicated that she lived in Wayne, Pennsylvania, near Bryn Mawr. In the Oc-
tober 1928 AMS membership list, she used an address of The Croft, Martin’s Dam,
Wayne, which apparently was where she lived the rest of her life. She and her sister
also made a trip from England to New York in April 1929, and her sister was listed
as living with her in the 1930 census.

Although Maddison spent her last years in Pennsylvania, she maintained her
identiﬁcation with the country of her birth as a member of the London Mathe-
matical Society and of the Daughters of the British Empire. She died in her home
in Wayne at age eighty-one in 1950. “In her will she bequeathed $10,000 to Bryn
Mawr in memory of M. Carey Thomas for use as a pension fund for nonfaculty staﬀ
members” (Tattersall and McMurran 1999, 301–2).
