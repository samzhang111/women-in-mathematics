HILL, Agnes (Baxter). March 18, 1870–March 9, 1917.
Dalhousie University (BA 1891, MA 1892), Cornell University (PhD 1895).

Agnes Sime Baxter was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, the daughter of
Janet (Methven) and Robert Baxter. Her parents were born in Scotland, her mother
in 1845 and her father in 1844. She had two younger siblings, a sister, Elizabeth,
and a brother, Norman, twins born in 1883. Her father was for many years manager
of the gas works in Halifax.

Baxter graduated from Dalhousie University in Halifax in 1891, the ﬁrst woman
at Dalhousie to take ﬁrst class honors in mathematics and mathematical physics; she
also received the Sir William Young Gold Medal for her academic accomplishments.
She remained at Dalhousie as a graduate student and received her master’s degree
in 1892. In 1937 her elder daughter wrote, “I always understood that mother was
the ﬁrst woman in Canada to take an M.A. in Math. I suppose – and I know that
until a few years ago there was only one other woman who had won the Sir William
Young Medal. Mother was too modest to ever tell us much of this” (Owens Papers).
Agnes Baxter entered Cornell University for graduate study in 1892. Her ﬁnal
year, 1894–95, she held an Erastus Brooks fellowship before receiving her PhD
in 1895 with major subject pure mathematics, ﬁrst minor mathematical physics,
and second minor physics. The year after receiving her doctorate, she remained at
Cornell editing the works of her advisor, James E. Oliver, who had died in March
1895.

On August 20, 1896, Agnes Baxter married Albert Ross Hill (1869–1943) in
Halifax. A. Ross Hill, also from Nova Scotia, received a BA from Dalhousie in
1892, studied a year in Europe, and received a PhD from Cornell in 1895 with a
dissertation in philosophy. At the time of their marriage A. Ross Hill was professor
of psychology and education at the State Normal School in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.
The following year he joined the philosophy faculty at the University of Nebraska.
While they were in Lincoln, Nebraska, they had two daughters, Jessie Methven
Hill, born December 13, 1897, and Ester Davison Hill, born March 19, 1903. In
1903 A. Ross Hill joined the educational psychology faculty at the University of
Missouri as professor and dean of the school of education. He spent 1907–08 as
professor, director of the school of education, and dean of the college of arts and
sciences at Cornell before returning the following year to Missouri as president of
the University of Missouri.

Agnes Hill died in 1917, shortly before her forty-seventh birthday, in Columbia,
Missouri, of pneumonia following inﬂuenza and operations during a lengthy illness.
Funeral services were held in the Columbia Presbyterian Church; she was buried
in the Columbia cemetery. After her death, A. Ross Hill presented Dalhousie with
a gift of books “to perpetuate the memory of one of its loyal graduates, who gave
her life to assist in [his own] educational work instead of making an independent
record for herself” (Wilkins and Dilcher 1988). On March 15, 1988, the Agnes
Baxter Reading Room, the library for the Department of Mathematics, Statistics,
and Computing Science at Dalhousie, was oﬃcially opened and dedicated.
