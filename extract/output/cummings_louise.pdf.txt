CUMMINGS, Louise D. November 21, 1870–May 9, 1947.
University of Toronto (BA 1895, MA 1902), Bryn Mawr College (PhD 1914).

Louise Duﬃeld Cummings was the daughter of Anne (Morison), born in about
1836 in Scotland, and James Cummings, born in about 1821 in Ireland. She was
born in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, where at the time of the 1881 Canadian census
her father’s occupation was described as collector. At that time, ﬁve children in the
household were listed: James, 23; Richard, 22, a teacher; Alice, 20; Sam, 15; and
Louisa, 10.

Louise’s brother Richard earned a BA from the University of Toronto in 1878
and became a physician in Wayne, Michigan. Alice was a pianist who taught at one
time at St. Margaret’s College for Ladies, a private high school in Toronto. Samuel,
who graduated in medicine from Toronto with an MB in 1888, became a surgeon
who was noted for his pioneering work with X-rays for the diagnosis and treatment
of medical problems.

Louise Cummings attended public schools and the Hamilton Collegiate Institute
in Hamilton, Ontario, before being admitted to the University of Toronto in 1889.
After attending in 1889–90, she was away for a year. In 1891–92, she returned to
Toronto as a second-year student and remained 1892–93 as a third-year student.
She was not in attendance 1893–94 but was a fourth-year student in 1894–95. She
won the William Mulock scholarship in mathematics her second year and half of
the physics scholarship her third year. Cummings received her bachelor’s degree
from Toronto in 1895 with ﬁrst class honors in mathematics.

Cummings spent most of the next ﬁve years in graduate study in mathematics
at four diﬀerent institutions. Although she was not listed as a graduate student,
she continued her study at Toronto in 1895–96 under the direction of Alfred T.
DeLury, who was later to become head of the department. The next year, 1896–97,
she held a Bennett fellowship, one of two given annually to women in the graduate
school (then called the department of philosophy) for study at the University of
Pennsylvania. In 1897–98 she was a student at the University of Chicago, and the
following year she was a resident fellow in mathematics at Bryn Mawr College. She
supervised examinations at Toronto in 1897 and held a fellowship by courtesy in
mathematics during the second semester of 1899–1900 at Bryn Mawr. During her
ﬁrst year at Bryn Mawr she gave two presentations, on Galois ﬁelds and on graphical
representation of groups, to the Mathematical Journal Club. Other speakers for the
year included professors Scott and Harkness of Bryn Mawr and Morley of Haverford,
and four students, including Grace Bareis and Emilie Norton Martin.

Cummings studied at the Ontario Normal College in Hamilton during the year
1900–01. She returned to Toronto in 1901 to continue her studies and to teach
mathematics at St. Margaret’s. Her master’s degree was awarded by the University
of Toronto in 1902.

In the fall of 1902, Cummings joined the faculty at Vassar College in Pough-
keepsie, New York, where she remained until her retirement more than thirty-three
years later. The other new member of the Vassar mathematics department that year
was Elizabeth B. Cowley. While there Cummings was instructor 1902–15, assistant
professor 1915–19, associate professor 1919–27, professor 1927–35, and professor
emeritus after her retirement. She was on leave for the second semesters of 1931–32
and 1934–35.

Louise Cummings continued her studies at Bryn Mawr College at various times
while on the faculty at Vassar. She was a graduate scholar during the ﬁrst semester
1905–06 and during the second semester 1912–13, when she was in residence at Bryn
Mawr for the academic year. She received her doctorate from Bryn Mawr in 1914
with subjects mathematics, applied mathematics, and physics. Both Henry Seely
White of Vassar and Charlotte A. Scott of Bryn Mawr had a role in her dissertation
work. White, who had earned his PhD at G¨ottingen in 1891, came to Vassar as
professor in 1905 and remained until his retirement in 1936. In her dissertation
vita Cummings acknowledges her indebtedness to Scott “for helpful criticism and
unfailing interest in the preparation of this paper” and to White “who suggested
. . . the subject of [the] dissertation.” She published a dozen papers over twenty years,
and her work is discussed in Hutchinson’s 1977 article, “Women in Combinatorics.”
Two of her papers were coauthored with White, who was president of the AMS
1907–08, and Frank Nelson Cole, who was secretary of the AMS 1896–1920. This
work was mentioned by E. T. Bell in his article on algebra in the Semicentennial
Addresses of the American Mathematical Society and in T. S. Fiske’s 1927 obituary
of Cole in which he notes that “Miss Cummings developed the earliest examples”
of a certain type (p. 775).

Cummings attended many meetings of the AMS and MAA and often gave pre-
sentations at the AMS meetings. In 1924 she was appointed to the MAA committee
to formulate the details for awarding the newly established Chauvenet prize. She
also attended the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Toronto in
1924 and in Zurich in 1932. She was given an honorary DSc degree by the Uni-
versity of Toronto at the university’s centennial celebration in 1927. The Carnegie
Foundation granted her a retiring allowance beginning February 24, 1936.

After suﬀering from severe arthritis for several years, Louise Cummings died in
1947 at the age of seventy-six at the home of her niece in Wayne, Michigan. She
was buried in the Hamilton, Ontario, cemetery.
