LeSTOURGEON, Elizabeth. June 1, 1880–February 6, 1971.
Georgetown College (BA 1909), University of Chicago (MA 1913, PhD 1917).

Flora Elizabeth LeStourgeon (also “Le Stourgeon”) was born in Farmville, Vir-
ginia, the daughter of Elizabeth Mary (Vinyard) (1854–1908) and Frederick George
LeStourgeon (1846–1904). Her father was born in Illinois and her mother in New
Jersey; they married in 1875 in Bridgeton, New Jersey. After their marriage her
father farmed and operated canning companies in and near Farmville. Elizabeth
LeStourgeon was the third child of seven; her siblings were: William George (1876–
1955), Annie Emily (1878–1951), Charles James (1882–1918), Arthur Lloyd (1886–
1958), Sarah Couth (1887–1970), and Percy Earl (1984–1977).

According to her master’s thesis educational brief, LeStourgeon received her
primary and secondary schooling in the Virginia State Normal School (oﬃcially the
State Female Normal School at Farmville, now Longwood University) and remained
a year in post-graduate study. Normal School catalogues indicate that she graduated
from the regular course with a full diploma in 1897 and remained 1897–98 as an
irregular student. She had teaching positions for the next several years including in
the public school in Bridgeton, New Jersey, from 1898 to 1901; in the Waynesboro,
Virginia, public school starting in 1901; and at St. Katharine’s School in Bolivar,
Tennessee, from at least 1906.

LeStourgeon studied several summers at the University of Virginia after it estab-
lished a summer program primarily for public school teachers in 1907. Although this
program allowed women to attend classes during the summer, it did not grant any
course credit to the women participants. LeStourgeon then entered Georgetown
College in Kentucky in September 1908 at age twenty-eight. After one academic
year there she received her bachelor’s degree. She took additional course work in
1909–10 and also taught in the preparatory department 1908–10. Her brother Percy
took some courses at Georgetown College 1909–11.

LeStourgeon was a professor of mathematics at St. Mary’s College, then an
Episcopal college for women in Dallas, Texas, 1910–12. She studied at the University
of Chicago during the summer quarters of 1911 and 1912 and for three quarters in
1912–13 as a holder of a scholarship in mathematics. Her master’s thesis, completed
in June of 1913, was written under the direction of A. C. Lunn. For her master’s
work, she took courses with H. E. Slaught, G. A. Bliss, E. J. Wilczynski, and A. C.
Lunn in mathematics and with Kurt Laves in astronomy.

LeStourgeon spent the next two years, 1913–15, teaching mathematics at Beaver
College in Pennsylvania, then a women’s college (now coeducational Arcadia Uni-
versity), before returning to the University of Chicago to complete her doctoral
work. She held a fellowship during the year 1916–17 and wrote her dissertation
in the calculus of variations under the direction of Bliss. In his 1972 book on the
history of mathematics, Morris Kline observed that, “so far as the basic deﬁnitions
of properties of functionals needed for the calculus of variations are concerned, the
ﬁnal formulations were given by Elizabeth Le Stourgeon” in the paper based on her
dissertation (p. 1080). E. J. McShane had mentioned this work earlier in the pub-
lished version of his 1938 address on the calculus of variations at the semicentennial
celebration of the American Mathematical Society.

After receiving her doctorate in 1917, LeStourgeon taught at the Liggett School
for Girls in Detroit. She was an instructor at Mount Holyoke College for the year

1918–19 and an assistant professor at Carleton College the following year. In 1920
she went to the University of Kentucky, where she was assistant professor 1920–26
and associate professor 1926–46. She had leaves of absence during the years 1927–
28 and 1944–45. She was in Europe in the summer of 1928. Her youngest brother,
Percy Earl LeStourgeon, was stationed at the University of Kentucky as assistant
professor of military science 1929–35.

While at the University of Kentucky she often spoke to and served as an oﬃcer
of the White Mathematics Club and the Pi Mu Epsilon chapter. She was a member
of the Kentucky Academy of Science. In about 1940 LeStourgeon was active in a
number of organizations including AAUW and AAUP and described herself as an
Episcopalian and a Democrat. In June 1941 she recovered from injuries suﬀered in
an automobile accident in Kentucky as she and a colleague in romance languages
started for summer vacations in Mexico.

In 1948 and 1950 LeStourgeon listed her address in the AMS membership list
as Delray Beach, Florida. By 1952 she was living in Washington, D.C., but appar-
ently continued to spend winters in Florida. By the early 1960s she had moved to
Bridgeton, New Jersey, where several relatives lived. Flora Elizabeth LeStourgeon
had been a member of AMS ﬁfty-nine years at the time of her death at age ninety
in 1971. She died at Bridgeton Hospital, where she had been a patient for four days.
She was survived by one brother and many nieces, nephews, and cousins, and is
buried in Overlook Cemetery in Bridgeton.
