HENRIQUES, Anna (Staﬀord). August 20, 1905–November 28, 2004.
Western College for Women (BA 1926), University of Chicago (MS 1931, PhD
1933).

Anna Adelaide Staﬀord was born in Chicago, Illinois, the eldest of six children
of Caroline (Fleuchaus) (ca. 1882–1919) and Richard W. Staﬀord (1881–1919). Her
parents were born in Chicago, and both had a high school education; they married
in 1904. At the time of the 1910 census they were living in Chicago, where her
father was manager of a pickle factory. Later he managed lumber companies. Her
brother, Richard W. (1907–1962), was born in St. Paul, Minnesota; her two sisters,
Mabelle L. (1910–1977) and Marcia Frances (1912–1991), were born in Chicago;
and her younger brother, Wirt W. (1914–1992), was born in Marshﬁeld, Wisconsin.
All were college graduates. Her youngest brother, Walter, died in infancy.

After her parents died in 1919, the ﬁve surviving Staﬀord children lived with her
father’s sister and her family, ﬁrst in St. Louis, Missouri, and later in Chicago. Anna
Staﬀord attended public schools in Chicago; Marshﬁeld, Wisconsin; and Barnum,
Minnesota, before graduating in 1922 from Frank Louis Soldan High School in St.
Louis. She attended Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio, with a four-year
college scholarship and an AAUW scholarship from the St. Louis AAUW. While
there, her majors were mathematics and Greek and her minor was French. She was
in the classical club, the French club, and the mathematics club; she participated
in theater; and she successfully participated in enough sports, baseball, hockey,
basketball, and swimming, to earn a blue “W.” In her college yearbook she is listed
as from Evanston, Illinois.

Following her graduation from Western College in 1926, Staﬀord taught mathe-
matics and science for two years at St. John Baptist School, an Episcopal school for
girls in New York and later in Mendham, New Jersey. She taught at the Darlington
Seminary in West Chester, Pennsylvania, 1928–29 and at St. John Baptist School
in Mendham 1929–31. During the summers 1927–29, 1931, and 1933, she attended
graduate school at the University of Chicago. From 1931 to 1933 she completed two
years of residency at Chicago; she earned her master’s degree in December 1931 and
her PhD in August 1933 as a student of Mayme I. Logsdon. Her dissertation was
in topology, a subject that had caught her attention upon hearing a lecture by
Raymond Wilder of the University of Michigan. However, there were no topology
specialists at Chicago, so she and Logsdon worked through the material together,
learning Italian to do so.

From 1933 to 1935 Staﬀord was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study
at Princeton, where she pursued her interest in topology. She was one of two women
who went to the IAS in 1933; the other was Mabel Schmeiser (Barnes). In the same
period, Staﬀord was on the faculty at St. John Baptist School, where she taught in
the mornings, so she could attend lectures at the Institute in the afternoons. From
1935 to 1937 she was an instructor at the University of Nebraska. While there
she published an article that ended with a bibliography of works that would aid
teachers in making the mathematics curriculum more interesting; the list included
Mayme Logsdon’s A Mathematician Explains and Helen Merrill’s Mathematical
Excursions. In the summer following her ﬁrst year of teaching, Staﬀord traveled in
Europe, where she attended the International Congress of Mathematicians at Oslo

and visited England, Holland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland,
and France.

In 1937 Staﬀord joined the faculty at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City
where she remained for nearly twenty years. Also that fall Harriet Rees (Bonner),
who had just earned her doctorate from Chicago, was appointed instructor at Utah
and served for a year and a half. In 1942 Anna Staﬀord married Douglas E. Hen-
riques, whom she had met in a church choir. He was born in Nevada in 1910 and was
an administrative law judge for the US Department of the Interior. He had a twelve-
year-old son by a previous marriage, Vico Emanuel, who became the president of the
Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers’ Association (CBEMA). They
later adopted a daughter, Virginia, a member of the Navajo Nation who was born
in Bluﬀ, Utah, and became a practical nurse.

At the University of Utah, Anna Staﬀord Henriques was instructor 1937–41,
assistant professor 1941–47, and associate professor 1947–56. In 1946 she revived
the mathematics club, which had become moribund some years earlier. She had a
sabbatical leave during the spring quarter 1949 during which she taught one class
while preparing a textbook for it. About the same time she wrote, but apparently
never published, a paper entitled, “Some mathematical aspects of modern life.” In
a 1997 interview, Tom Apostol remarked that his “best mathematics teacher [at
the University of Utah] was Anna Henriques” (Albers and Apostol, 258).

In 1956 Douglas Henriques’s work took him from Utah to New Mexico, and
so the family moved. In 1957 Anna Henriques became a lecturer at St. Michael’s
College (the College of Santa Fe since 1966). Two years later she also became a
lecturer at the University of New Mexico and remained in both positions until
1962 when she became professor at St. Michael’s. She retired in 1971 as professor
emeritus. Shortly thereafter she and her husband were living in the Falls Church
area of Fairfax County, Virginia, where they remained. Once retired, Douglas and
Anna Henriques traveled, making trips to every continent.

Anna Henriques delivered several papers to professional organizations of which
she was a member: the MAA, the NCTM, the Utah Council of Teachers of Math-
ematics (UCTM), and the Utah Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Letters. She held
many positions in the Utah and New Mexico branches of AAUW and served as pres-
ident, program director, and bulletin editor of the UCTM. She was also a member
of Delta Kappa Gamma, a women’s education honor society. She was involved with
the Girl Scouts in 1955. During her lifetime her interests included mountain climb-
ing, hiking, bowling, opera, theater, and travel. She was a generous contributor to
the MAA and the IAS.

Douglas Henriques died in November 1987. Anna Henriques later moved to Good-
win House Bailey’s Crossroads, a retirement community in the Falls Church area,
and died there of congestive heart failure in 2004 at ninety-nine. She was survived
by her step-son, Vico Henriques, two granddaughters, and ﬁve great-grandchildren.
