YOUNG, Mabel M. July 18, 1872–March 4, 1963.
Wellesley College (BA 1898), Columbia University (Teachers College) (MA
1899), Johns Hopkins University (PhD 1914).

Mabel Minerva Young was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, the daughter of Minerva
(Tyler) (1847–1894) and Willie C. Young (1847–1909), both of Massachusetts. Her mother
graduated from the Oread Institute, a private school and college for girls and women in
Worcester, before her marriage in 1871. She was later described as musical. In 1880 the
Youngs and their two daughters, Mabel, age seven, and Edith, age two, were living in
Worcester with Willie Young’s parents. Willie Young was a machinist and bookkeeper
and later president of the W. C. Young Manufacturing Company that made machinists’
tools. He was chairman of the school committee at the time of his wife’s death and was a
Republican member of the Massachusetts state legislature in 1896 and 1897. He remarried
in 1897. Edith C. Young was in the Wellesley College class of 1900.

Mabel Young attended public schools in Worcester for her primary and secondary
education. For the latter she completed a ﬁve-year course at Classical High School, from
which she graduated as salutatorian. It was observed in a 1941 article in the Wellesley
Alumnae Magazine that when she entered Wellesley College in 1894 she was unusually well
prepared, especially in Greek, Latin, and mathematics, and that she had already decided
on mathematics thanks to an excellent high school teacher.

During her four years at Wellesley, Young studied mainly English, mathematics, phi-
losophy, and psychology before receiving her bachelor’s degree in 1898. She spent the next
year, 1898–99, at Columbia University, where she did work in education and psychology
and earned her MA and a master’s diploma in education from Teachers College, Columbia,
in 1899.

Young taught in schools 1899–1904. In particular, from 1899 to 1902, she taught mainly
English at the Northﬁeld Seminary, a girls’ preparatory school in Massachusetts. In 1904
she returned to Wellesley as an assistant in mathematics and was made an instructor
in 1906. In 1904–08 she was enrolled in three hours a week of graduate courses in pure
mathematics at Wellesley. At the same time, she was teaching one or two freshman sections
each semester. Young did graduate work at Cornell University during the summer of 1908.
Young applied for admission to the Johns Hopkins University in the fall of 1909, was
accepted, and was in residence there 1909–10 and again 1912–14, while she had leaves of
absence from Wellesley 1909–11 and 1912–14. She was a fellow by courtesy at Johns Hop-
kins, with remission of tuition fees, 1913–14. Her dissertation in algebraic geometry was
directed by Frank Morley. Morley and Abraham Cohen signed the recommendation for
its acceptance on May 30, 1914: “The problem is solved completely; and the work is done
carefully and understandingly. The style shows a cautious and critical New England intel-
ligence” (Student ﬁles, Ferdinand Hamburger Archives, The Johns Hopkins University).
Young received her doctorate in 1914 with physics as a ﬁrst subordinate subject.

The remainder of Young’s career was spent at Wellesley. She remained an instructor
until 1919; she was assistant professor 1919–24, associate professor 1924–30, professor
1930–41, and emeritus professor after her retirement in 1941. During the year 1930–31 she
traveled for six months in the Mediterranean region while on a leave of absence for study
and travel.

Young was a charter member of the MAA and served on the arrangements committee
for the ﬁrst summer meeting of the MAA that was held at MIT in September 1916. Two
years later she and Helen Merrill, then chairman of the department at Wellesley, prepared
the index for the 1918 volume of the Monthly. From the early 1920s through the early
1930s, Young was also a regular contributor of problems and solutions to the Monthly.

In 1932 Helen Merrill retired from Wellesley and the department chairmanship that she
had held for sixteen years. The following year Young became department chairman and

remained so until her retirement. She was the Lewis Atterbury Stimson professor for some
years. Her teaching at Wellesley included primarily geometry and statistics, although she
preferred the theoretical to the more applied work.

Young’s interests included music and travel. In addition to that noted above, she trav-
eled in France and Germany in the summer of 1922 and in Norway and Sweden in the
summer of 1936 when she attended the International Congress of Mathematicians in Oslo.
In about 1940 she described herself as Congregational and a Republican. After her death
in 1963 at age ninety in a nursing home in Wellesley, memorial services were held at the
chapel on the Wellesley College campus.
