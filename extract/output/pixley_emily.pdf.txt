PIXLEY, Emily (Chandler). August 19, 1904–August 28, 2000.
Randolph-Macon Woman’s College (BA 1926), University of Chicago (MS
1927, PhD 1931).

Emily McCoy Chandler was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, the daughter of Mayme
(McCoy) (b. ca. 1879) and David Sanders Chandler (b. 1876), both Tennessee na-
tives. The 1920 census lists three daughters: Emily, age ﬁfteen; Dorothy A., age ten;
and Carlotta B., age two months. Her father was a district passenger agent with
the railroad.

Chandler attended primary and secondary school in the Knoxville public school
system and graduated from Knoxville High School in 1922. She then entered Ran-
dolph-Macon Woman’s College (now Randolph College) in Lynchburg, Virginia,
where she majored in psychology and mathematics and minored in English. One
of her teachers was Gillie Larew, who had been a mathematics faculty member at
Randolph-Macon since 1903 and who later served as a personal reference for Chan-
dler. While at Randolph-Macon, Chandler was active in student government, the
YWCA, and the Inter-racial Committee. Immediately after her graduation, Chan-
dler entered graduate school at the University of Chicago in the summer quarter
of 1926. She attended four straight quarters before receiving her master’s degree in
1927 with a thesis in analysis written under the direction of L. M. Graves.

After receiving her master’s degree, Chandler took a position as instructor and
acting head of the mathematics department at Saint Xavier College for Women
(now Saint Xavier University) in Chicago while she continued her graduate work
part time at the University of Chicago. After four years she ﬁnished the work for
her doctorate, having studied with L. E. Dickson and Mayme I. Logsdon, among
others. She wrote her dissertation in number theory under Dickson and received
the PhD in 1931.

A fellow graduate student at Chicago was Henry Howes Pixley, who also earned
a master’s degree in mathematics in 1927 and a doctorate in 1931 as a student
of Graves. Pixley was born in Skaneateles, New York, on July 18, 1902, received
most of his elementary and secondary education in Michigan, graduated from high
school in Florida, and received his BA degree in 1923 and MA degree in 1924 from
John B. Stetson University in Deland, Florida. Between 1924 and 1931, the date of
his doctorate from Chicago, Henry Pixley held instructorships at Georgia School of
Technology (now Georgia Institute of Technology), Rutgers University, Bryn Mawr
College, and the College of the City of Detroit. Emily Chandler and Henry Pixley
were married on September 8, 1931.

Although inquires for a position in Detroit for Emily Chandler were made in
the spring of 1931, both Pixleys retained their positions after their marriage, she at
Saint Xavier in Chicago, where she continued as professor and department chairman
1930–36, and he at the College of the City of Detroit as instructor 1930–34. In 1933–
34 Emily and Henry Pixley had leaves of absence from their academic positions and
worked in areas having to do with labor productivity and mathematical economics
for the National Recovery Administration. Three of the tables she prepared for the
NRA appeared in a 1935 article, “Economic theory of the shorter work week,” by
Charles F. Roos (Econometrica 3:21–39).

In 1933 the College of the City of Detroit united with other public colleges in
Detroit, and in 1934 the institution was named Wayne University; it was renamed

Wayne State University in 1956. Henry Pixley remained at Wayne as assistant
professor 1934–37 and associate professor from 1937 until his retirement in 1972.
After 1945 his responsibilities were largely administrative; he was assistant dean of
the College of Liberal Arts 1945–47; director of admissions, records, and registration
1947–53; and associate dean of administration 1953–69 before returning to the
classroom as associate professor.

In 1936 Emily Pixley began an association of a dozen years with Wayne Univer-
sity. She was hired in September 1936 as a special instructor with an hourly salary.
She worked as a special instructor part time 1936–42 and full time 1942–47. Also,
during her ﬁrst years there, the Pixleys had three children: Dorothy Anne, born in
August 1937; David Chandler, born in June 1939; and Richard Henry, born in June
1942.

In September 1947 the title of Emily Pixley’s position changed from special in-
structor to regular substitute assistant professor with a teaching load of sixteen
hours per week. In April 1948, in a memo from the mathematics department chair-
man to the dean, it was noted that there had been “progress in the matter of
adherence to the university policy relative to employment of man and wife,” a pol-
icy that had been ignored for three years because of the diﬃculty in hiring “qualiﬁed
personnel.” He also wrote that “while the quality of teaching will be lowered some-
what by making Mrs. Borgman and Mrs. Pixley the ﬁrst to go, university policy
demands that this be done, and I have already made clear to those aﬀected that
this will require the termination of their services in June 1949” (Alfred L. Nel-
son, Mathematics Department, to Dean C. B. Hilberry, April 23, 1948, University
Archives, Wayne State University).

Emily Pixley did not wait for the university anti-nepotism policy to be satisﬁed
by the termination of her services in 1949, but found employment at the University
of Detroit (now University of Detroit Mercy) for the academic year 1948–49. She
spent the remaining twenty-ﬁve years of her career there: as assistant professor
1948–51, associate professor 1951–56, and professor from 1956 until her retirement
in 1973 as professor emeritus. She also served as acting department chair in the
summers 1963–69 and in the academic year 1968–69. One of her sons reported for
her obituary in the Detroit Free Press that “she was never formally named chair
because of her gender.”

In the late 1940s Emily Pixley indicated that her church preference was Congre-
gational and that she had traveled in Alaska, Europe, and the United States. She
also noted that she read French, German, and Italian. She had recently served as
chairman of the faculty wives scholarship committee at Wayne and as president of
the Randolph-Macon alumnae, presumably in Detroit.

Henry Pixley died in Detroit on October 9, 1985, at age eighty-three. Emily
Pixley remained in the metropolitan Detroit area and died on August 28, 2000,
at age ninety-six, in Presbyterian Village Redford in Redford Township, Michigan.
She was survived by her two sons, a sister, eight grandchildren, and ﬁve great-
grandchildren.
