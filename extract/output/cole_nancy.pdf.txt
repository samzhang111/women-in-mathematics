COLE, Nancy. October 15, 1902–July 7, 1991.
Vassar College (BA 1924), Radcliffe College (MA 1929, PhD 1934).

Nancy Cole was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the only child of Gertrude
(Groce) (1870–1949) and Albert Henry Cole (1868–1925), both of Massachusetts.
Ancestors of her mother had come to Plymouth on the Mayﬂower in 1620; those of
her father had come to Plymouth in 1630. Her mother, a normal school graduate,
and her father, a high school graduate, were married in 1898. Her father was in the
grocery business.

Cole graduated from high school in Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1919 and stud-
ied there as a post-graduate an additional year before entering Jackson College, the
coordinate women’s college associated with Tufts College (now University) at that
time. She was at Jackson College with a Whiting scholarship 1920–22. She then
attended Vassar College for two years and received her bachelor’s degree in 1924.
From 1924 to 1926, Cole taught algebra and geometry to students preparing for
college at the Oxford School in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1926–27 she studied at
Radcliﬀe College, and the following year she taught at Vassar as an instructor. Cole
studied at Radcliﬀe 1928–29 while also working as a tutor there. She received her
master’s degree in 1929 and continued as a student at Radcliﬀe with scholarship
assistance through 1931. In 1930 she and her widowed mother were living in Cam-
bridge, Massachusetts, although they maintained the family home in Plymouth.

Cole was an instructor at Wells College 1931–32. On February 20, 1933, she
replied to a note from Eugenie Morenus who had inquired about her interest in a
position at Sweet Briar College. Cole wrote, “I am in Plymouth this winter, writing
my thesis and working on Professor Morse’s Colloquium Lectures on the Calculus
of Variations in the Large. Perhaps I have told you before, that for the latter I do
the typing, ﬁll in the formulae, and check the mathematics” (Faculty Files, Sweet
Briar College Archives). Morse was also her dissertation advisor.

In the fall of 1933, Cole took a position as instructor at Sweet Briar College in
Virginia, where, except for leaves, she remained for a decade. She replaced Ethel
Moody, a 1930 Cornell PhD who left Sweet Briar for a position at Pennsylvania
State College. The department head at Sweet Briar was Eugenie Morenus, a 1922
Columbia PhD who had been at Sweet Briar since 1909.

Over the two-year period 1932–34 Cole ﬁnished her graduate requirements and
received her PhD from Radcliﬀe in 1934. She served as acting department head at
Sweet Briar in 1934–35 and in 1941–42. While teaching at Sweet Briar, Cole was a
member of the Virginia Academy of Science. She also regularly attended meetings
of the AMS, a practice she continued until about 1950.

Cole began a leave from Sweet Briar in February 1943 to take a wartime ap-
pointment as visiting assistant professor and then visiting associate professor at
Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. Her ﬁrst full year at Kenyon, she was lecturer
and teacher in mathematics in the Pre-Meteorology Program for the Army Air
Force, and was a teacher in the Army Specialized Training Program from February
until July 1944.

Nancy Cole resigned from Sweet Briar in May 1944 and after leaving Kenyon was
assistant professor at Connecticut College for Women 1944–47. In 1947 she took a
position as assistant professor at Syracuse University, where she was to remain the
rest of her career. Ruth Wyckliﬀe Stokes, who had earned a PhD from Duke in 1931,

had joined the faculty at Syracuse the previous year, also as assistant professor. At
Syracuse, Cole was assistant professor 1947–52, associate professor 1952–71, and
associate professor emeritus after her retirement in 1971. In addition to her stan-
dard undergraduate teaching, Cole taught courses in ﬁnance, statistics, probability,
statics, dynamics, vector analysis, and higher mathematics for engineers and physi-
cists to undergraduates and some graduate students, and calculus of variations to
graduate students. In March 1980 she was called back to take over an advanced cal-
culus class when a colleague died suddenly. She reported that it was “a stimulating
experience after nine years of retirement!” (Smithsonian questionnaire 1985).

In her 1985 questionnaire Cole also reported that her interest in mathematics
was stimulated ﬁrst by her high school geometry teacher Lucia Richardson; then
by Tufts professor Edith L. Bush; by the chair of the mathematics department at
Vassar, Henry Seely White; and by the several Harvard faculty members with whom
she studied while doing her graduate work at Radcliﬀe.

Cole was a reader of the mathematical attainment test for the College Entrance
Exam Board 1938–41 and served on the promotion and services committee of the
Association of Mathematics Teachers of New York State 1958–65. She also held
various oﬃces with the Syracuse chapters of Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi, and Sigma
Delta Epsilon. For the twenty-year period before her retirement, Cole was the per-
manent faculty secretary of the local chapter of Pi Mu Epsilon, the national math-
ematics honor society, which was founded in 1914 at Syracuse.

Cole traveled extensively and attended the International Congresses of Math-
ematicians in Oslo (1936); Cambridge, Massachusetts (1950); Edinburgh (1958);
Stockholm (1962); Nice (1970); Vancouver, British Columbia (1974); Helsinki (1978);
and Berkeley (1986). In 1983 she traveled to the People’s Republic of China as a
member of a delegation of American university mathematics education specialists
organized by People-to-People International to participate in a bilateral technical
exchange with their Chinese professional counterparts.

In 1985 Cole described her political aﬃliation as Independent and her hobbies
as hiking and swimming. From 1950 she was aﬃliated with the Foundation for
Christian Living, now the Peale Center for Christian Living, in Pawling, New York.
She was also a member of the Antiquarian Society of Plymouth, Massachusetts,
from before 1950 and of the Pilgrim Society in Plymouth after 1961.

Nancy Cole died of a heart attack in her home in Plymouth, Massachusetts, at
the age of eighty-eight in 1991. She was survived by a cousin and three second
cousins. A memorial service was held at the Chiltonville Congregational Church
in Plymouth. Philip Church ended his 2002 biography of Cole for the Syracuse
department website by noting that “she was a good and thoughtful colleague and
a very ﬁne teacher.”
