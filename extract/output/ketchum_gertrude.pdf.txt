KETCHUM, Gertrude (Stith). August 4, 1903–September 27, 1958.
University of Georgia (BA 1924, MA 1928), University of Illinois (PhD 1934).

Gertrude Stith was born near Nunez, Georgia, the eldest of ﬁve surviving children
of Louella (Jones) (b. ca. 1882) and John R. Stith (b. 1862), a farmer. Her mother
was a native of Georgia and her father of North Carolina. At the time of the 1910
census, her mother was twenty-eight, had been married for eight years, and had
three surviving children of four born. These were Gertrude, age six; Estelle, age ﬁve;
and Mabelle, age four. Her father was forty-eight, had been married previously, and
had a step-daughter, a son, and two daughters from a previous marriage. Gertrude
Stith’s parents had two children after 1910: Pauline, born in about 1913 and John
in about 1921. Neither of the parents had an advanced education.

A school superintendent who boarded with the family was an inspiration to
Gertrude Stith, who was the ﬁrst of her siblings to go to college. Immediately after
graduating from the University of Georgia, Stith began teaching in high schools in
Georgia. She taught in Hawkinsville 1924–25 and in Athens 1925–28. In 1928 she
also completed her work for her master’s degree at the University of Georgia.

From 1928 to 1930 Stith was a student assistant in the mathematics depart-
ment at Brown University. She borrowed money from a local bank to ﬁnance her
studies there; nevertheless, she was unable to continue at Brown for ﬁnancial rea-
sons. However, she was able to continue her graduate education after obtaining an
assistantship at the University of Illinois for the year 1930–31.

After a year at Illinois, on July 6, 1931, Gertrude Stith married Pierce Waddell
Ketchum, a member of the mathematics faculty. Ketchum, born September 5, 1903,
in Salt Lake City, had earned his bachelor’s degree in 1922 from the University of
Utah and his master’s degree in 1923 and doctorate in 1926 from the University of
Illinois. Except for periods away as a member of the Institute of Advanced Study
in 1937–38, a fellow and visiting lecturer at Brown 1942–43, and as head of the
analysis section of a gunnery school with the US Air Force 1944–45, he spent his
career in the mathematics department at Illinois: as instructor 1926–28, associate
1928–37, assistant professor 1937–42, associate professor 1942–47, professor 1947–
69, and professor emeritus after his retirement in 1969.

Because of anti-nepotism rules, Gertrude Stith Ketchum could not continue as
a teaching assistant after her marriage. Although she was not allowed to teach,
Gertrude Ketchum was allowed to continue as a graduate student, which she did
for the year 1931–32. Their ﬁrst child, Pierce Stith, was born in June 1933, after
which Gertrude Ketchum resumed her studies in 1933–34, ﬁnished her dissertation
in analysis under the direction of R. D. Carmichael, and received her PhD in 1934
with a minor in English. The following April 1935, their daughter, Laura Stith, was
born. In a 1937 letter to Helen Owens about the summer meetings in State College,
Pennsylvania, Ketchum noted her appreciation for the provision of entertainment
for small children.

Gertrude Ketchum had two publications in mathematics, one based on her dis-
sertation, which was published in 1936 in the Transactions of the AMS and was
cited by other mathematicians into the early 1940s, and one a few years later that
was coauthored with her husband. She continued her involvement in mathematics
by proposing and solving problems that appeared in the American Mathematical
Monthly and the National Mathematics Magazine at least through 1941. In 1983

her husband said that she was hurt by not being able to teach when they ﬁrst
married but that some years later she was able to teach part time.

Gertrude Ketchum had always been active and athletic with a particular interest
in riding. In high school she had organized a girls’ basketball team. At the University
of Georgia she had been president of the university chapter of the YWCA, captain
of the riﬂe team, and had ridden in university horse shows. Later she used her
expertise in horsemanship as an instructor of equitation for ﬁve years at riding
camps for girls.

In 1952 Gertrude Ketchum became ill with cirrhosis of the liver and died at
home in Urbana six years later at age ﬁfty-ﬁve. She was cremated and her remains
interred at Fairlawn Cemetery in Decatur, Illinois. In 1961, three years after her
death, P. W. Ketchum married Gertrude’s younger sister Estelle.

In 1963 Laura Ketchum Kodama, the daughter of Gertrude and Pierce Ketchum,
earned her PhD in mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley. P. W.
Ketchum died on February 24, 1993.
