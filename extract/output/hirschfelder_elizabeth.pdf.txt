HIRSCHFELDER, Elizabeth (Staﬀord). April 25, 1902–September 29, 2002.
Brown University (Women’s College) (PhB 1923, MS 1924), University of Wis-
consin (PhD 1930).

Elizabeth Thatcher Staﬀord, the eldest of three children, was born in Providence,
Rhode Island, to Evangeline K. (Flagg) (1877–1966) and Arthur Ervin Staﬀord (b.
1875), a banker. Her mother was a direct descendent of Roger Williams, the founder
of Rhode Island. Her parents, both natives of Rhode Island, married in 1899, and
she had two younger brothers, Stuart W. (b. 1904) and Harvey Chace (b. 1906).
Harvey graduated from Brown University in 1927 and became an accountant in
Manhattan.

Staﬀord’s family lived very close to Brown University. Because of ﬁnancial diﬃ-
culties in 1918, she was only able to attend college by living at home. She attended
Women’s College of Brown, graduated in 1923, and remained at the university an
additional year in order to earn her master’s degree. In a 1995 interview for the
Oral History Program at the University of Wisconsin, she mentioned both R. G. D.
Richardson and R. C. Archibald when asked if there were any faculty at Brown who
had inﬂuenced her. She noted that Archibald’s inﬂuence extended beyond math-
ematics to his second interest, music, as he bought seats for students at Boston
Symphony Orchestra concerts held in Providence. She also remarked that there
were two other women in her class at Brown and all three got teaching jobs in col-
leges when they graduated; Ellen Clayton Stokes and Evelyn Wiggin (Casner) also
received master’s degrees from Brown in 1924. Elizabeth Staﬀord took a position as
a last-minute replacement for a faculty member at the University of Texas. Letters
of recommendation from Richardson reﬂect his high opinion of her. In one he noted
that she was well-trained, well-balanced and cultured and that she would be a great
success there. She spent the year 1924–25 as an instructor in pure mathematics (for
$1800) at the University of Texas in Austin. In December 1924 Richardson notes
in a letter to her that it is very ambitious if she takes a course for credit.

Since no position was available for Staﬀord at the University of Texas the fol-
lowing year, she applied for a job at Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech
University) in Lubbock, which was scheduled to oﬀer its ﬁrst instruction at the
postsecondary level in September 1925. She was hired as an adjunct professor and
remained until 1928.

During the summer of 1927, Staﬀord attended summer school at Brown and took
a graduate course from Mark H. Ingraham. Ingraham, who had received his PhD
at Chicago in 1924 under E. H. Moore, left Brown for the University of Wisconsin
in 1927 and urged Staﬀord to apply there for a fellowship so she could do graduate
work with him. She took a leave from her position at Texas Technological College,
studied at the University of Chicago in the summer of 1928, and entered the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin with a fellowship in mathematics that fall. In October 1929, she
and seven men were admitted to candidacy for the PhD. She held a fellowship again
in 1929–30, and in 1930 she received her degree in linear algebra as Ingraham’s ﬁrst
doctoral student at Wisconsin.

While Staﬀord was in Texas she had worked with H. S. Vandiver on computations
to check Fermat’s Last Theorem. In 1929, Vandiver, who had come to the University
of Texas in 1925, published a paper in the Transactions of the AMS in which
he acknowledged Staﬀord’s assistance with the computations. The following year,

while Staﬀord was at the University of Wisconsin, they coauthored a paper on
the subject that appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Vandiver continued to publish papers on Fermat’s Last Theorem and continued to
acknowledge Staﬀord’s contributions.

Staﬀord reported later that while she was at Wisconsin she “had fallen in love
with this man who worked in the mathematics department” (Teicher interview
1995). She returned to Lubbock for the year 1930–31 and then went back to Madi-
son, where on June 6, 1931, she was married to Ivan S. Sokolnikoﬀ (1901–1976) of
Russia. Ivan Sokolnikoﬀ immigrated to the United States in 1921, did his under-
graduate work at the University of Idaho, and received his PhD from Wisconsin
in 1931. After a honeymoon trip to Manchuria to visit his parents that summer,
both returned to the mathematics department at Wisconsin. He progressed from
instructor to professor until he left in 1946 to ﬁnish his career at the University of
California at Los Angeles.

Elizabeth Sokolnikoﬀ ﬁrst served as instructor at Wisconsin 1931–32 and then
continued in a number of irregular positions. Correspondence in the archives at Wis-
consin reveals circumstances of her initial appointment and of some appointments
subsequent to it. On September 15, 1931, Warren Weaver, then the department
chair, wrote to Dean Sellery, the dean of the college, noting that the department
wanted to recommend the temporary appointment of Mrs. Sokolnikoﬀ since an in-
structor had left. He wrote, “We could not hope to get a person of Mrs. Sokolnikoﬀ’s
training and ability for the salary involved ($1800) except under very unusual cir-
cumstances.” In a letter of February 8, 1932, Mark Ingraham, the new chairman,
wrote to the dean regarding proposed budget cuts: “Mrs. Sokolnikoﬀ has taught
full time at a salary of $1800. Mrs. Sokolnikoﬀ took her degree here a few years
ago and is both from mathematical ability and teaching ability a person of very
superior quality–one who could well rank as an assistant professor in any university.
If we make the cut contemplated above, it would seem almost necessary to drop
her from the pay roll or retain her only for part time. I feel in general it is not
well to tie ourselves up with husbands and wives on the pay roll, but it is with
great reluctance that I would make this change during the year when we have lost
Professor Weaver.” On May 19, 1932, another letter from Ingraham to the dean
followed regarding the Sokolnikoﬀs.

There is no reason in justice why he [I. S. Sokolnikoﬀ] should not
be getting as much as the other assistant professors in the De-
partment. Moreover, although Mrs. Sokolnikoﬀ is one of our best
instructors and is better prepared than any other instructor to give
advanced work, we have omitted her from the tentative budget for
next year due to the fact that you do not feel it wise to retain the
wife of a member of the Department on the staﬀ. Although you
may feel that this action is both necessary and wise, you can read-
ily understand how it would be discouraging to the Sokolnikoﬀs in
light of the fact that they must know that there are a number of
other couples engaged in teaching at the University of Wisconsin.

After a year as instructor and a year without a position, Elizabeth Sokolnikoﬀ was
hired primarily as a lecturer on an ad hoc basis for the next several years.

During World War II, Elizabeth Sokolnikoﬀ, like Grace Hopper, wanted to join
the US Navy WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service) but was
told that she should teach mathematics instead. During the war, I. S. Sokolnikoﬀ
spent much of his time in New York and Washington working with the National
Defense Research Council. Elizabeth Sokolnikoﬀ spent the war years in Madison
teaching calculus and diﬀerential equations to army and navy groups, geologists,
and engineers. In her 1995 interview, she said that “we were separated a lot during
those war years. . . . I was very much in favor of [Ivan’s going to California] and very
much in favor of my not going to California with him.” Before their separation, the
Sokolnikoﬀs had a fruitful mathematical relationship; in the period 1934 to 1941
they coauthored ﬁve signiﬁcant mathematical papers in analysis and the classic text
Higher Mathematics for Engineers and Physicists. They were divorced in 1947, the
year after I. S. Sokolnikoﬀ went to UCLA. In 1947 Elizabeth Sokolnikoﬀ was given
a three-year appointment as assistant professor. In 1952 she was an invited speaker
at a symposium on the mathematical training of engineers held at the summer
mathematics meetings in East Lansing, Michigan. The symposium was described
in an article in the Monthly the following year.

On March 7, 1953, Elizabeth S. Sokolnikoﬀ married Joseph Oakland Hirschfelder
(1911–1990), a professor of chemistry at Wisconsin. She took a leave of absence for
the year 1953–54. Joseph Hirschfelder was a native of Baltimore who had done his
undergraduate work at Yale and received a PhD from Princeton in physics and
chemistry in 1936. He joined the chemistry department at Wisconsin in 1937 and
remained until his retirement in 1981 except for military research during World War
II. Between 1942 and 1946, he was with the National Defense Research Committee
(NRDC) in Washington, D.C., was a group leader at Los Alamos working on the
development of the atomic bomb, and was at a naval ordinance test station in
California. Some years after his return to Madison, he was the founder of UW-
Madison’s Theoretical Chemistry Institute. He was elected to the National Academy
of Sciences in 1953 and was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1976. After
their marriage, Elizabeth Hirschfelder spent the summer proofreading a lengthy,
and later, classic text that her husband coauthored. Joseph O. Hirschfelder also
acknowledged the help of his wife in papers he published in the mid-1950s. He
retired from Wisconsin in 1981.

In 1954 Elizabeth “Betty” Hirschfelder resigned her position as assistant pro-
fessor of mathematics in order to be able to accompany Joseph “Joe” Hirschfelder
when he traveled to give lectures. In 1957 they took a trip around the world. In
the mid-1970s they began to split their time between Madison, Wisconsin, and
Santa Barbara, California, where Joe Hirschfelder was an adjunct professor at the
university. Joseph Hirschfelder died of cancer in their home in Madison in 1990. In
the early 1990s, Betty Hirschfelder helped endow a fellowship at the University of
California at Santa Barbara; the UCSB Faculty Women’s Club makes awards of
the Broida-Hirschfelder Graduate Fellowship in the Sciences to doctoral students
in all ﬁelds of engineering, science, and mathematics. She provided funding for the
Joseph O. Hirschfelder Prize in Theoretical Chemistry established at the University
of Wisconsin in 1992 in honor of her late husband and was a leading donor for an

addition to the chemistry building there for which ground was broken in September
1999.

Elizabeth S. Hirschfelder spent her winters in Santa Barbara and died at age one
hundred in September 2002 in Madison, Wisconsin. She left signiﬁcant bequests to
the Broida-Hirschfelder Endowment and to the University of Wisconsin that allowed
for the establishment of the Elizabeth Hirschfelder Fund for Graduate Women in
Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics.
