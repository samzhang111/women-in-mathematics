LADD-FRANKLIN, Christine. December 1, 1847–March 5, 1930.
Vassar College (BA 1869), Johns Hopkins University (PhD completed 1882,
awarded 1926).

Christine Ladd was born in Windsor, Connecticut, the eldest of the three children
of Augusta F. (Niles) (1825–1860) and Eliphalet Ladd (1822–1885). Both of her
parents came from old New England families, her father’s from New Hampshire
and her mother’s from Connecticut. Her parents married in 1846. Her brother,
Henry (b. 1850), was born while the family lived in New York where her father
was a merchant. Her sister, Jane Augusta (b. 1854), was born after the family had
moved to her maternal grandmother’s home in the Poquonock section of Windsor in
1853. Many years later Ladd described her father as having been both a merchant
and a gentleman farmer. Ladd’s mother, who was a supporter of women’s rights,
died of pneumonia when Ladd was twelve. Soon after her mother’s death Ladd
began keeping a journal. In 1862 her father married Mary E. Barnes (1839–1903),
and they had two children, Katharine (b. 1865) and George B. (1867–1881).

From 1860 to 1863, Ladd attended schools in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, while
living with her paternal grandmother. She spent the next two years at a college
preparatory school, the Wesleyan Academy. The school had been coeducational
since it opened in Wilbraham, Massachusetts, in 1825 because “in the school as in
the [Methodist] church, the sexes were to have a common platform of opportunity”
(Sherman, History of the Wesleyan Academy, 77). Nonetheless, the male and fe-
male students were enrolled in diﬀerent courses of study, and at graduation males
presented orations and females presented essays. Although a number of sources
say that Ladd graduated as valedictorian of her class, the program for the June
1865 “Anniversary Exercises of Wesleyan Academy” lists another female student as
presenting the “Valedictory Essay” and Ladd as presenting the “Classical Essay.”
Just before leaving for her second year at Wilbraham, Ladd saw a notice an-
nouncing the planned opening of Vassar College in fall 1865. She hoped to attend
but did not think her father would “give his consent to such a Quixotic scheme”
(Ladd Diary, 10 Aug 1864). In fact, Ladd’s father, who was very supportive of her
studies at Wilbraham, had ﬁnancial and health problems in the mid-1860s, and
Ladd spent 1865–66, the year after she graduated from Wilbraham, at home in
Poquonock with her infant half-sister. Her maternal grandmother, eighty-one years
old in 1865, was not supportive of her furthering her education, thinking that Ladd
would not be able to ﬁnd a husband after college. However, by the end of July 1866
Ladd had convinced her grandmother to support her plans to attend college and
had convinced her mother’s older sister, Juliet Niles, to pay the tuition. At ﬁrst
her father did not approve her plans but agreed in a short time, and in Septem-
ber 1866 Ladd enrolled at Vassar. Ladd studied at Vassar 1866–67 and 1868–69.
She did not return 1867–68 because of a lack of funds; instead, she spent the fall
semester teaching in Utica, New York. At Vassar she was inﬂuenced strongly by
the astronomer Maria Mitchell and by Charles S. Farrar, professor of mathematics,
natural philosophy, and chemistry. She was most interested in physics, particularly
in the vibrations of the elastic pendulum.

After graduating from Vassar in 1869, Ladd began teaching at a girls’ school in
Hollidaysburg, a town near Altoona in the mountains of central Pennsylvania. She

spent two years there and at the beginning of her second year teaching reported
that she was doing “special investigations in Physics, and in mathematical research”
(letter to Auntie [Juliet Niles], 7 Sep 1870). In May 1871 she was oﬀered, and
accepted, a position at a seminary in Washington, Pennsylvania, in the southwestern
part of the state. While in Washington, she studied with George C. Vose, a professor
of mathematics at Washington and Jeﬀerson College, then a small all-male liberal
arts college. Ladd described Vose as “among the ﬁrst ten or twelve mathematicians
in the country . . . [who] leaves his family to poverty and dirt, while he absorbs
himself in Quarternions [sic]” (Ladd Diary, 14 Nov 1871). Prior to working with
Vose, Ladd had considered studying in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with James Mills
Peirce or in St. Louis, Missouri, with William Chauvenet. In a June 9, 1872, entry in
her diary Ladd mentions what appears to be her ﬁrst publication in mathematics,
a problem on quaternions that appeared in the London Educational Times. One
month later, on July 16, she wrote in her diary that she had intended to spend the
entire summer vacation studying with Vose; however, her brother had intimated in
a letter “that ﬁlial obligations require my presence at home,” so she would stay in
Pennsylvania only until the end of the month.

The last entry in the Ladd diaries preserved at Vassar College was on April 27,
1873, and was written while she was living with relatives in Boston, Massachusetts.
It begins, “From October to January, Mathematical courses at Harvard University.
Not as proﬁtable as they might have been, as they were not followed by an examina-
tion.” Although the “Harvard Annex,” the precursor to Radcliﬀe College oﬃcially
known as the Cambridge Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women, was not
founded until 1879, and there is no record of Ladd’s having attended classes at Har-
vard, she reported in November 1872 that she was regularly enrolled as a student
there and was attending lectures of W. E. Byerly, then a graduate student, and J.
M. Peirce, “Jimmie Mills as we Harvard fellows call him” (letter to Auntie, 3 Nov
1872, Box 2, Christine Ladd Franklin and Fabian Franklin papers). Although the
ﬁnal entry in her diary concludes: “Have applied for a second degree at Vassar” (27
Apr 1873), Ladd did not continue her formal studies at the time. She remained in
the Boston area, taught at Chelsea High School, and continued her informal work
in mathematics. In early 1875 Ladd’s ﬁrst publication, other than problems and
their solutions, appeared in the Analyst, the recently founded American journal,
which became the Annals of Mathematics in 1884. In it she reported on the con-
tents of the Journal f¨ur die reine und angewandte Mathematik (Crelle’s Journal),
one of the most important European mathematical journals, and noted that in the
Boston Public Library the journal was on the shelves with its leaves uncut.

By the spring of 1875 Ladd was teaching in Union Springs, New York. In the
spring of 1876 she met friends from Woods Hole while visiting nearby Cornell
University and spent some time studying biology. It appears that she also studied
mathematics at Cornell. J. L. Coolidge’s obituary of W. E. Byerly in the Bulletin
of the AMS notes that Ladd was a student of Byerly when he was an assistant
professor at Cornell 1873–76. It also suggests that Byerly’s experience teaching her
may have been a factor in his “favorable opinion of the intellectual capacity of
women” and his 1879 support for providing private classes for women at Harvard,
where he was then an assistant professor (p. 296).

Ladd remained in Union Springs through at least May 1878. In a letter of March
1877 she reported that she was writing a mathematics book. Also while in Union

Springs, problems that she posed and those that she solved appeared frequently in
the Educational Times; the Analyst; the Mathematical Visitor ; and a local newspa-
per, the Yates County Chronicle. From the ﬁrst issue of the Mathematical Visitor
(October 1877) we learn that Ladd is “Professor of Natural Sciences and Chemistry,
Howland School, Union Springs, Cayuga County, New York.”

On March 27, 1878, Ladd wrote to J. J. Sylvester asking him whether Johns
Hopkins University would refuse her permission to listen to his lectures “on account
of [her] sex?” (Gilman Papers). At the time she did not mention her publications
but described herself only as “a graduate of Vassar College . . . [who had] attended
mathematical lectures at Harvard University.” On April 2, 1878, Sylvester wrote
Daniel Coit Gilman, president of Johns Hopkins, that he “should rejoice to have
her as a fellow worker among us. . . . My own impression is that her presence among
us would be a source of additional strength to the University.” In an undated letter
detailing Ladd’s accomplishments he noted that “she is favorably known to Dr.
Salmon and Prof. Cayley with each of whom she has corresponded on Mathematical
subjects correcting an error or imperfection in a treatise of the one and suggesting
an improvement in a memoir or book of the other. She is well known in America
and England and in a second number of The Analyst . . . she has written a profound
paper on Quaternions” (Gilman Papers).

Despite this endorsement by Sylvester, Johns Hopkins would not admit her, or
any other woman, as a student. However, the executive committee of the board of
trustees was “willing that the Faculty should examine & certify to the attainments
of ladies who may oﬀer themselves, without having been instructed here, as can-
didates for academic degrees” (D. C. Gilman to Miss Ladd, April 26, 1878, MS 1,
Daniel Coit Gilman Papers, Special Collections, Sheridan Libraries, The Johns Hop-
kins University). They also consented to her attending Sylvester’s lectures without
charging her tuition.

Ladd spent the next four years studying at Johns Hopkins and traveling in
Europe. During this time she was not oﬃcially enrolled in the university but, at
times, received the stipend of a fellow. She continued contributing to the Edu-
cational Times and the Analyst and published substantial articles in the second
and third volumes of the American Journal of Mathematics. She appears to have
enjoyed strong support from the mathematics faculty. An apparently unsolicited
letter from William E. Story, Thomas Craig, Fabian Franklin, and O. H. Mitchell
suggested that she be given the fellow’s stipend upon her return from an extended
trip to Europe in early 1882. The spring 1882 term was her last at Johns Hopkins.
What should have been her dissertation for an 1882 PhD was published in Studies
in Logic by Members of the Johns Hopkins University, which was edited by her
advisor, C. S. Peirce, brother of J. M. Peirce with whom Ladd had studied at Har-
vard. However, the board of trustees did not permit her to be awarded the degree
because she was a woman.

On August 24, 1882, Ladd married Fabian Franklin (1853–1939), a member of
the Johns Hopkins mathematics faculty. Franklin was born in Eger, Hungary, im-
migrated to the United States when he was four, received his bachelor’s degree from
Columbian College (now George Washington University) in 1869, worked as a civil
engineer and surveyor until 1877, and earned his PhD in mathematics at Johns Hop-
kins in 1880. In June 1883, their infant son died shortly after his birth. Two months
later, on August 17, Lucien A. Wait, then associate professor of mathematics at

Book Web Page

Cornell, wrote to Fabian Franklin: “I am very glad to hear that Mrs. Franklin has
so much improved. Her acceptance of work in my correspondence University gives
me great pleasure” (Box 6, Christine Ladd Franklin and Fabian Franklin Papers).
However, there is no indication that she ever actively participated in this venture.
The following summer she gave birth to a daughter, Margaret Ladd Franklin.

Although Christine Ladd-Franklin never held a regular position in Baltimore,
in 1887 she reported that she taught “for an hour or so every morning in Miss
Randolph’s school” and that she had “no private pupils at present” (letter to Auntie,
14 Nov 1887). Later, in 1889, she turned down a position as lecturer at Bryn Mawr.
During this time she continued her mathematical research and began a career in the
area of physiological optics. Her ﬁrst paper in this ﬁeld, which was a mathematical
investigation of binocular vision, appeared in 1887. That same year Vassar College
bestowed on her an LLD, the only honorary degree it has ever granted. During this
period some of her papers appeared under the hyphenated name Christine Ladd-
Franklin, but she did not use this name consistently until about 1905; before then
her name appeared in various forms including C. Ladd Franklin.

In 1891 Fabian Franklin took a sabbatical leave in Germany with his wife and
daughter. Ladd-Franklin spent part of that year in G¨ottingen in the laboratory of
G. E. M¨uller but was denied the oﬃcial status of student. She also spent part of
the year in Berlin working in Hermann von Helmholtz’s laboratory. While in Berlin
she began a correspondence with Felix Klein concerning the admission of women
to G¨ottingen. In May 1892 she learned from Klein that “for the time being [the
G¨ottingen faculty] mainly support only what will not satisfy you, the admission of
female guest auditors (under control of the prorector [vice chancellor] and with the
assumed assent of each individual docent)” (Box 4, Christine Ladd Franklin and
Fabian Franklin papers). The next summer, at the World’s Columbian Exposition
in Chicago, she met Mary Frances Winston (Newson), who was to become one
of the ﬁrst three guest students and the ﬁrst American woman to earn a PhD in
mathematics from a German university. When Winston did not receive a fellowship
from the Association for Collegiate Alumnae (ACA, later AAUW) in order to attend
G¨ottingen, Ladd-Franklin oﬀered her $500 to help cover her costs for the year.

In 1894 Ladd-Franklin returned to Berlin without her family in order to work for
several months on her theory of color vision in Arthur K¨onig’s laboratory. She had
announced her ﬁrst results in this area two years earlier and continued publishing in
it for another thirty years. In a 2000 article, D. C. McCarty included Ladd-Franklin
among seven names that appeared in “name indices of historical works on logic
and . . . on those on nineteenth century perceptual physiology” and noted that “in
those days, a liaison between thought and sight was recorded in the vocabulary that
physiologists and psychologists adopted for visual processes and phenomena” (p.
368). It was on the basis of work in this ﬁeld that in 1906 Christine Ladd-Franklin
was starred for psychology in the ﬁrst edition of American Men of Science. It was
also on the basis of this work that she was oﬀered an honorary doctorate by Johns
Hopkins to be bestowed during the university’s ﬁftieth anniversary celebration in
1926. Rather than accept the honorary degree, she asked for, and received, the
doctorate she had earned forty-four years earlier.

During the time that she was working in the theory of color vision, Ladd-Franklin
kept up her interest in logic. In 1892 she published a review of the ﬁrst volume of
Ernst Schr¨oder’s Vorlesungen ¨uber die Algebra der Logik ; that review has been

Book Web Page

LADD-FRANKLIN - 5

cited frequently in articles on the history of logic. In 1893 she asked to give a series
of lectures on that subject at Johns Hopkins and was turned down. Starting in
1904 she became the only woman on the Johns Hopkins faculty, teaching there
as a part-time lecturer in logic and psychology while being paid considerably less
than the $500 stipend she had received as a student. There was no question of
anti-nepotism practices keeping her from being hired since Fabian Franklin had
resigned his position as associate professor at Johns Hopkins in 1895 in order to
become editor of the Baltimore News. She remained a part-time lecturer until 1909
when she moved to New York with her family. The move to New York was to allow
Fabian Franklin to take a job as an associate editor of the New York Evening Post.
He resigned that position in February 1917 over a political disagreement with the
paper’s owner and in 1919 started his own literary and political weekly publication,
The Review, which later merged with The Independent to become The Independent
and The Weekly Review . While in New York, Christine Ladd-Franklin taught as an
unpaid part-time lecturer in logic and psychology at Columbia University.

In addition to her many scholarly publications, Ladd-Franklin frequently wrote
popular articles and letters to newspapers and news magazines, none of which
are included in her list of publications below. These were mainly concerned with
women’s rights, but also addressed other current events in which she had an inter-
est, such as the use of Esperanto or the less well known international language Ido.
She worked particularly hard in the cause of women’s higher education. In 1897 she
was involved in the formation of an organization to advance this cause, the Balti-
more Association for the Promotion of the University Education of Women, and
served as its chairman pro tem. This association tried to get Johns Hopkins to open
its graduate school to women. This attempt was not successful, and the trustees
did not agree to enroll women oﬃcially in graduate courses until 1907. At various
times Ladd-Franklin served on the ACA committee on fellowships, serving as its
ﬁrst chairman, and speaking to that association on “The Usefulness of Fellowships”
in October 1894. That talk was reprinted in the AAUW Journal in March 1953 with
the comment that “sixty-three years later, it strikes such a sympathetic chord for
those of us most closely associated with our fellowship program that we cannot
resist representing it here in its entirety” (46:166). In 1899–1900 she and the three
women who had received ACA European fellowships in mathematics, Ruth Gen-
try, Annie MacKinnon (Fitch), and Mary Winston (Newson), served on the ACA
Council to Accredit Women for Advanced Work in Foreign Universities. She was
also instrumental in the establishment of the Sarah Berliner fellowship and served
as chairman of the committee that made the award until 1919 when the AAUW
took over that role.

Christine Ladd-Franklin’s scholarly bibliography includes over one hundred arti-
cles and reviews in logic and color theory. In 1929, the year before she died, a volume
containing her collected works on color vision was published in the series Interna-
tional Library of Psychology, Philosophy, and Scientiﬁc Method; it was reprinted
in 1973 in the series Classics in Psychology. In addition to the selected publications
listed below and the many papers in color theory, there are additional mathematical
works, published mainly under the name Ladd, including more than ﬁfty solutions
of questions from the Educational Times and the Analyst, some of which were ab-
stracted in the Jahrb¨uch ¨uber die Fortschritte der Mathematik (JFM) or listed in
Alonzo Church’s “Bibliography of Symbolic Logic (1666–1935)” in the inaugural

Book Web Page

volume of the Journal of Symbolic Logic. Church also listed articles that she had
written for J. Mark Baldwin’s 1902 Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology, for
which she served as associate editor for logic and psychology. In addition, Church’s
bibliography included an article on symbolic logic, which Ladd-Franklin had coau-
thored with E. V. Huntington, that appeared in the 1905 Encyclopedia Americana;
in 1908 E. B. Wilson wrote in a review of a 1906 “critical-historical study of the
logical calculus” that “the mathematician is almost certain to ﬁnd more of value
to him in the excellent though brief account of symbolic logic” by Huntington and
Ladd-Franklin (p. 190). In 1938 she was described as “always militant in behalf of
her color theory and the rights of women” (Boring, 414). Her work in logic was
examined in a 1999 article in the Bulletin of Symbolic Logic.

Christine Ladd-Franklin died of pneumonia at age eighty-two at her home in

New York City in 1930. She was survived by her husband and her daughter.
