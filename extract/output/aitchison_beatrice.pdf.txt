AITCHISON, Beatrice. July 18, 1908–September 22, 1997.
Goucher College (BA 1928), Johns Hopkins University (MA 1931, PhD 1933),
University of Oregon (MA 1937).

Beatrice Aitchison was born in Portland, Oregon, the daughter of Bertha Beat-
rice (Williams) (1877–1935) and Clyde Bruce Aitchison (1875–1962). Her parents
were natives of Iowa and married in 1906. She had a younger brother, Clyde Bruce
Aitchison Jr. (1909–1969), who became a lawyer. Her mother was a musician and
singer; her father was a lawyer who had a distinguished career serving on state and
federal regulatory commissions and in private practice.

Clyde B. Aitchison, her father, earned a BSc from Hastings College in 1893, an
MA from the University of Oregon in 1915, and a PhD in economics from Amer-
ican University in 1932. After completing his undergraduate work, he studied law
in a private law ﬁrm in Iowa and was admitted to the Iowa bar in 1896. He moved
to Oregon in 1903 and served on various regulatory commissions there until 1916.
The family moved to Washington, D.C., when he became solicitor for the National
Association of Railway Commissioners in 1916. In 1917 he became a member of
the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and served as its chairman four times
before his retirement in 1952. He then had a private law practice until his death.
He had an extensive record of writings, lectured at American University for a dozen
years, and received numerous awards, including honorary LLD degrees from Hast-
ings College and the University of Oregon. After his ﬁrst wife’s death, he married
Ada Chenoweth McCown (1886–1944), a political scientist who had earned a PhD
from Columbia University in 1927 and was serving as a researcher in legislative
reference at the Library of Congress just before their marriage in 1936.

Beatrice Aitchison attended private school for four years in Portland before the
family moved to Washington, D.C., where she attended public schools. She gradu-
ated with honors from Central High School in Washington shortly before her six-
teenth birthday. She reported in 1981, “I think that high school was very important
to me . . . . I had two excellent instructors who were probably just out of college . . .
and who were very excited about teaching” (Smithsonian meeting tapes). She then
attended Goucher College 1924–28. After graduating from Goucher in 1928, she
worked for a year in New York City for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company
as its ﬁrst female actuarial clerk. For eleven months in 1928–29 she took special
courses while working in New York, and she passed the ﬁrst four parts of the ex-
aminations of the American Institute of Actuaries and of the Actuarial Society
of America in April 1929. Aitchison reported later that at just barely twenty she
“couldn’t cope with New York City,” so she resumed her study of mathematics in
October 1929 at Johns Hopkins University (Smithsonian meeting tapes). From 1929
until 1932 she was a University scholar at Johns Hopkins and earned a master’s
degree in 1931 and a PhD in 1933.

Since the Great Depression was in full force at the time of her doctorate, jobs were
diﬃcult to ﬁnd. Aitchison recalled, “I applied to 145 colleges and universities my
last spring at Hopkins . . . . Someone whom I didn’t know but knew my background
held my application thinking she might have an opening at Westhampton College
[the college for women] at the University of Richmond. Sure enough, [one of the
faculty members] got really sick and so on about three days notice I was down there
teaching for one semester” (Smithsonian meeting tapes). After that semester as

acting associate professor, she served as lecturer in statistics at American University
in Washington, D.C., 1934–35. She also wrote in her 1981 Smithsonian questionnaire
that American University “invited [her] to ‘help’ with statistics for ‘experience’ and
no pay.” She did, however, get credit for a graduate course in history of economic
thought.

Aitchison’s mother died in the spring of 1935, and she returned to Oregon where
she took a University of Oregon extension course in Portland in principles of eco-
nomics. In 1936 she was a ﬁeld supervisor for the Oregon Historical Records Survey
of the WPA in Portland before spending the academic year 1936–37 at the Uni-
versity of Oregon. In 1937 she received her second master’s degree, this one with
honors in economics. When she returned to Washington in 1937, she again lectured
in statistics at American University, continuing to do so through 1938–39; she also
served as a member of the faculty of the graduate school of the US Department of
Agriculture. Starting in 1938 Aitchison held temporary assignments at the ICC and
while in Washington she lived in her father’s house near Dupont Circle. She was
one of thirty-ﬁve residents of the area interviewed in 1984 and 1985 for a master’s
thesis, “Slices of the Pie: Black and White Dupont Circle from the 1920s to the
1950s” by Mara Cherkasky.

Aitchison returned to the University of Oregon as an economics instructor in
1939. She continued her temporary assignments with the ICC during the summers
and prepared a report for its Bureau of Statistics that was published in 1941. At the
beginning of 1942 Aitchison resigned her position in Oregon and began her long and
distinguished career as a transportation economist with the US government. Her
ﬁrst position was with the ICC, where from 1942 to 1948 she advanced from junior to
senior statistician, and from 1948 until 1951 she served as principal transportation
economist. During her service with the ICC, Aitchison continued to teach as a
lecturer in statistics at American University 1942–44. From 1942 until 1945, she was
a consultant and head of traﬃc analysis for the Oﬃce of Defense Transportation,
and in 1950 she was assigned from the ICC as a consultant to the director of military
traﬃc of the Department of Defense. In 1946 Aitchison was a founding member of
the American Society of Traﬃc and Transportation (now the American Society of
Transportation and Logistics).

Aitchison left the ICC in 1951 and worked until 1953 as director of the Transport
Economics Division of the Oﬃce of Transportation at the US Department of Com-
merce. After this post was abolished in 1953, she worked for the US Post Oﬃce until
she retired in July 1971. Aitchison was director of transportation research 1953–58,
director of transportation research and statistics 1958–67, and director of trans-
portation rates and economics in her last position 1967–71. After her retirement
she was self-employed as a consultant in transportation issues.

In the period from the mid-1940s to the 1970s, Aitchison conducted studies on
transportation issues, testiﬁed before numerous regulatory agencies, and gave many
talks on postal history and transportation at institutes and meetings of various
transportation groups and postmasters’ conventions around the country. In addition
to technical reports listed below, Aitchison wrote at least ﬁve others, two in the
late 1950s and three in the early 1970s, that do not appear to be available in any
library.

During and after her government career, Aitchison received many honors. Gou-
cher presented her with an Alumnae Achievement Citation in 1954 and awarded her

an honorary DSc in 1979. In 1961 she was one of six career women in government
chosen to receive the ﬁrst annual Federal Woman’s Award given by the Civil Service
Commission. As a consequence of receiving this award, she was a member of the
Federal Woman’s Award Study Group on Careers for Women, a small group of
award recipients who were asked by President Lyndon Johnson to make a study of
careers for women. The group’s recommendations resulted in an amendment to the
executive order banning discrimination in government employment to include sex
discrimination.

In receiving the Federal Woman’s Award she was cited for her leadership in
research and training in transportation economics and traﬃc management. It was
noted that as a result of her work, “the postal service was able to realize millions
of dollars in savings.” Her obituary in the Washington Post reports that “in the
1960s, she supervised a ﬁve-year study leading to renegotiation of contracts with
air carriers, saving the government an estimated $50 billion a year.”

In 1970 Aitchison was honored by the National Civil Service League with the
Career Service Award as one of the top ten government workers of the year, the only
woman in the group. She was named an Alumni Fellow of the College of Arts and
Sciences at the University of Oregon in 1996. The following year the Johns Hopkins
Alumni Association honored her with a Woodrow Wilson Award for outstanding
government service noting that she was one of the highest ranking women in the
federal service at the time of her retirement.

In addition to consulting after her retirement, Aitchison spent signiﬁcant time
in volunteer work with the elderly. She received a certiﬁcate with honors for a
paralegal training program for seniors at George Washington University’s Institute
of Law and Aging where she studied in 1977–78. In the early 1980s she indicated
that she spent forty to ﬁfty work days a year doing income taxes for the elderly
with the IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) Program.

Among her interests were music, photography, sewing, and traveling. The Wash-
ington Post obituary states that she had studied the mamba and the samba at
Fred Astaire’s dancing school and that “she also traveled widely, often by tramp
steamer, to such locations as the South Paciﬁc and Antarctica.”

Beatrice Aitchison described her political aﬃliation as mainly independent. She
was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution, served on a hospital
board, and was active in the Goucher Club of Washington, serving as treasurer and
president. She also was a trustee of Goucher College 1969–72.

She was an active Episcopalian serving in a variety of positions. In 1963 she was
the ﬁrst woman elected to the vestry of Epiphany Episcopal Church in Washington,
D.C. She held many other positions in the church, including positions on the vestry
of St. Margaret’s Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., in the 1980s. Altogether
she sang in church choirs from the time she was a young teen until about two years
before her death.

She was very supportive of the schools where she had received her education.
Summer grants for junior Goucher College faculty are available through the Beat-
rice Aitchison ’28 Non-Tenured Faculty Professional Advancement Fund. Aitchison
was also generous in her contributions to the Goucher library, allowing the librarian
to select about eighty volumes from her personal library in 1963. In 1994 she es-
tablished the Aitchison Public Service Fellowship, now called the Aitchison Public
Service Undergraduate Fellowship in Washington, at Johns Hopkins.

Collections of her papers are deposited at the Schlesinger Library, Radcliﬀe Insti-
tute, Harvard University, and at the University of Oregon. Those at the Schlesinger
Library deal with the period 1943–56 and contain articles and speeches by her as
well as news releases concerning her appointment to the US Post Oﬃce. The more
extensive collection at Oregon covers the period 1946–70 and includes records of
the Civil Aeronautics Board, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Post
Oﬃce Department, as well as speeches and addresses.

In 1997 Beatrice Aitchison died of congestive heart failure at eighty-nine at Sibley

Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C. She left no immediate survivors.
