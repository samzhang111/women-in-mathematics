COLE, Margaret (Buchanan). August 18, 1885–September 10, 1959.
West Virginia University (BA 1906), Bryn Mawr College (PhD 1922).

Margaret Buchanan was born in Clinton, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Sarah
(Wiley) (b. 1858) and Aaron Moore Buchanan (b. 1856), natives of Pennsylvania.
Her father graduated from Washington and Jeﬀerson College in 1879 and from
Western Theological Seminary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1882, the year her
parents married. She was the second of three children; her brother, Joseph Kerr,
was born in 1883 in Pennsylvania, and her sister, Mary B., was born in 1894 in
West Virginia. Mary was deceased by 1910. Her father was a Presbyterian minister
who moved from Pennsylvania to Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1886. He received
the DD degree from Washington and Jeﬀerson College in 1899.

From 1898 to 1902 Margaret Buchanan attended the preparatory school of West
Virginia University at Morgantown before entering that university in 1902. While
there she was one of a handful of women in her class. She was a member of the
English club, Le Cercle Dramatique Francais, the YWCA, the athletic association,
the yearbook board, the tennis club, the Athenaeum (student newspaper) board,
and Kappa Delta sorority. She served as secretary of several of these organizations
at least half a dozen times. Later, she was one of the founders of Beta Upsilon
chapter of the social sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma there.

After Buchanan’s graduation from West Virginia University in 1906, she taught
mathematics for a year at Marshall College (then a state normal school, now Mar-
shall University) in Huntington, West Virginia. She returned to West Virginia Uni-
versity in 1907 as a graduate student. She was an assistant in Greek and math-
ematics and taught in the university’s preparatory school 1907–09. She was also
an instructor of mathematics at the university 1909–12 before entering Bryn Mawr
College for graduate study in 1912. She studied at Bryn Mawr College as a scholar
in mathematics 1912–13, taught mathematics at the Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr
1913–14, taught mathematics in the high school at Parkersburg, West Virginia,
1914–15, and was instructor of mathematics at West Virginia University 1915–18.
In the summer of 1918 she was a temporary oﬃce assistant on the scientiﬁc staﬀ
of the state geologist preparing the statistics and coal maps for the West Virginia
geological survey of Webster County.

Buchanan returned to her graduate studies at Bryn Mawr College as a resident
fellow in 1918–19 and as a graduate scholar in 1919–20, having attended the Uni-
versity of Chicago in the summer of 1919. She was awarded a President M. Carey
Thomas European fellowship in 1918–19 for use the following year. She postponed
that fellowship and was a resident scholar at Bryn Mawr 1919–20. She used the
postponed fellowship and an Association of Collegiate Alumnae European fellow-
ship in 1920–21 to study at the Sorbonne in Paris. While there she studied under
Edouard Goursat, Henri Lebesgue, and ´Emile Picard in mathematics and under
Marie Curie and M. Gabriel Lippmann in physics. She had previously traveled
in Europe in the summer of 1910. In 1921–22 she ﬁnished her work for the PhD
from Bryn Mawr as a fellow by courtesy, the ﬁrst doctoral student of Anna J. Pell
(Wheeler). Her doctorate, with a minor in physics, was awarded in June 1922.

Buchanan returned to the faculty of West Virginia University as assistant pro-
fessor and was promoted to associate professor in 1925. She resigned her position
to marry, on February 14, 1929, Harry Outen Cole (1874–1950). Cole was a native

of Morgantown, an 1898 graduate of West Virginia University, and a construction
engineer who had, in the ﬁrst decade of the century, played a role in the design
of the Panama Canal. He had known Margaret Buchanan from the time she was
a child since her father was the pastor of the Presbyterian church to which he be-
longed. He was widowed in 1921 and from about that time was president of Cole
Bros. Construction Company in Morgantown.

In 1938 Margaret B. Cole again joined the faculty at West Virginia University
and was instructor 1938–41, assistant professor 1941–52, associate professor 1952–
55, and associate professor emeritus after her retirement in 1955 at age sixty-nine.
A colleague at West Virginia University was Bird M. Turner with whom she had
also overlapped as a graduate student at Bryn Mawr College.

As an active alumna of West Virginia University, Cole became the ﬁrst woman
president of the university’s alumni association in June 1939 after serving four years
on the alumni executive council. She joined the university alumni association’s
emeritus club, for alumni of ﬁfty or more years, in 1956 and was vice president in
1958–59.

Margaret Buchanan Cole died in Morgantown in 1959, four years after her re-
tirement. She was survived by her brother, a step-daughter, two nephews, and a
niece.
