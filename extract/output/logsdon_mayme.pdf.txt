LOGSDON, Mayme (Irwin) February 1, 1881–July 4, 1967.
University of Chicago (BS 1912, MA 1914, PhD 1921).

Mayme Irwin was born in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, the daughter of Nan Belle
(Farmer) (1857–1892) and James David Irwin (1852–1921), both of Kentucky. She
was the second of ﬁve children from her father’s ﬁrst marriage; her brothers were
William F. (1879–1944), Jessie C. (1884–1957), and Robert T. (b. 1888); her sister
was Mary (1892–1981). There were three children from her father’s second marriage
in about 1894: Madge L. (b. 1895), Myrtle I. (b. 1897), and James D. Jr. (b. ca.
1906). Her father, a constable in Elizabethtown in 1880, became an attorney in
1883.

Mayme Irwin attended public primary and secondary schools and graduated
from the Hardin Collegiate Institute, all in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. The Institute
was primarily a preparatory school with a business course and a teachers’ course, in
which Irwin probably was enrolled. Although Logsdon wrote in her 1914 master’s
thesis vita that she had received a BA from Hardin, it is unlikely that the degree
represented a four-year program.

Irwin was a high school teacher and principal from 1900 to 1911. On August 1,
1900, she married Augustus H. Logsdon (1859–1909), a businessman of nearby Mun-
fordville. Logsdon had two children from his ﬁrst marriage, Nell (b. ca. 1892) and
Ollie Preston (1897–1990); there were no children from his marriage with Mayme Ir-
win. In 1910, the year after she was widowed, Mayme Logsdon and her stepchildren,
then eighteen and twelve, were living with their aunt and uncle in Elizabethtown.
Her stepson remained with an aunt in Elizabethtown, while her stepdaughter later
moved to the west, where she married and lived in Wyoming.

Logsdon returned to school in 1911 at the University of Chicago, where she
completed the work for her bachelor’s degree in August of 1912. She began her
graduate study there in 1912 and after a year took a position as the mathematics
instructor and dean of women at Hastings College in Nebraska. After her ﬁrst year
there, 1913–14, she returned to Chicago for the summer and completed the courses
and thesis for a master’s degree. She remained at Hastings College as professor
of mathematics and dean of women for three more years, 1914–17. While there
she taught all of the mathematics courses, college algebra through diﬀerential and
integral calculus.

Logsdon was an instructor at Northwestern University 1917–19 before resuming
her graduate work at Chicago, as a fellow in 1919–20 and as an associate in 1920–21.
After completing her doctorate at age forty in 1921, she remained at the Univer-
sity of Chicago as instructor 1921–25, assistant professor 1925–30, and associate
professor 1930–46; she retired as associate professor emeritus in 1946.

Mayme Logsdon was the only woman to hold a regular faculty position above the
rank of instructor in the Chicago mathematics department before 1982. In addition
to her faculty duties, she served as a dean in the College of Science 1923–27 and was
head of Kelly Hall, a graduate dormitory, for many years. Later she had a house
built in Ogden Dunes in nearby northwestern Indiana and commuted to Chicago.
Although Logsdon was a student of L. E. Dickson, her interests shifted to al-
gebraic geometry early in her career at Chicago. She sailed to Italy in June 1925
to study in Rome on a foreign fellowship granted by the International Education
Board. Shortly before Logsdon returned from Italy in 1926, she gave a lecture in

Rome based on her 1925 paper in the Transactions of the AMS. As noted in his au-
tobiography, Apprentissage d’un mathematicien, Andre Weil attended the lecture,
and it was from the oﬀprints of this paper that he learned of Mordell’s work on
elliptic curves. In his autobiography, Weil referred to Logsdon as “la jeune ameri-
caine” although at the time of her lecture he was nineteen and she was forty-ﬁve.
In a private correspondence with one of the authors, Robert P. Langlands of the
Institute for Advanced Study wrote, “I found Weil’s treatment of her rather ungen-
erous, as she in fact put him on the trail of something important in his career. . . .
[S]he recognized the interest and importance of the theorem of Mordell, and . . .
simply having drawn Weil’s attention to it earns her a small place in the history of
mathematics.”

Logsdon resumed her duties at Chicago in October 1926. The following year she
was appointed the MAA representative to the American section of the Interna-
tional Mathematical Union that was planning the 1928 International Mathematical
Congress in Bologna. During the early 1930s she refereed papers submitted to the
Bulletin and the Transactions of the AMS and presided at scientiﬁc sessions at
meetings of that organization. At the University of Chicago, Logsdon regularly
gave advanced courses in algebraic geometry and directed the PhD dissertations
of four students in this area between 1933 and 1938. The students were Anna A.
Staﬀord (Henriques) 1933, James Edward Case 1936, Clyde Harvey Graves 1938,
and Frank Ayres, Jr. 1938. During this period she was also interested in under-
graduate education, and, in addition to giving talks in that area, she wrote two
textbooks. The two-volume Elementary Mathematical Analysis, which appeared in
1932 and 1933, is what might now be called an elementary functions or precalculus
textbook; the 1935 A Mathematician Explains treats topics prerequisite to calcu-
lus and brieﬂy introduces both diﬀerential and integral calculus. In a 1937 article
about the mathematics curriculum in schools, her student Anna Staﬀord noted that
A Mathematician Explains “is not the kind of book you expect the public to get
excited about, but it is selling. When a news company orders twelve dozen copies
you know it is not for any altruistic notions about aiding the the cause of science.
People want to read that book” (p. 408).

Logsdon was a member of the Central Association of Teachers of Mathematics
and Science, a charter member of the MAA and an MAA governor-at-large 1940–42.
She also founded the Illinois section of Delta Kappa Gamma, an honorary society
for women in education, and was active in Sigma Delta Epsilon (now Sigma Delta
Epsilon/Graduate Women in Science), for which she was president in 1939 and
received applications for fellowships in the early 1950s. She held oﬃces in Chicago
chapters of AAUW, Phi Beta Kappa, and Sigma Xi.

After her retirement in 1946 from the University of Chicago, Logsdon moved to
Florida, where she taught mathematics at the University of Miami until her second
retirement at age eighty in 1961. After living in Miami for a while, she had a house
built in Coral Gables, where she lived until she moved to a nursing home. Logsdon
was a Baptist and a Democrat. She was an avid bridge player, who traveled around
the country to earn masterpoints. Her many international travels included trips to
most of Europe, the Yucatan, the Caribbean, and Greece. She was also interested
in swimming, golf, and birds. She has been described by a relative and a family
friend as “a magnet,” “personable,” “fun, funny, can do,” “vivid,” and “warm.”
Langlands wrote of her, “Given her age at the time she ﬁnished her thesis, her

subsequent development suggests a spirit and cast of mind that were intellectually
open and adventurous.” At her death in 1967 at the age of eighty-six in Coral
Gables, Mayme Logsdon was survived by her sister, Mary E. Irwin, of Chicago.
