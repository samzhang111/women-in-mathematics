DEAN, Mildred (Waters). February 17, 1904–September 11, 1981.
Goucher College (BA 1924), Johns Hopkins University (MA 1927, PhD 1929).

Mildred Caroline Somerset Waters was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the second
of two daughters of Caroline F. (b. 1870) and Robert F. Waters (b. 1867) from
Maryland. Her parents were married in about 1896, and her older sister, Ruth, was
born in 1898. Robert Waters was proprietor of a feed store; in 1920 her sister was
a kindergarten teacher.

Mildred Waters had her early education in public and private schools in Balti-
more before doing her undergraduate work at nearby Goucher College. After her
graduation in 1924, she was a graduate student in chemistry at the Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore for the year 1924–25. She transferred to the mathematics
department in the fall of 1925, continued her work in residence at Johns Hopkins
the next two years, and received her master’s degree in 1927. Her master’s essay,
directed by Frank Morley, was the beginning of the work in inversive geometry that
she was to continue for her PhD dissertation.

In the fall of 1927, Mildred Waters married Charles Earle Dean (1898–1993), who
had received his PhD in physics that year from Johns Hopkins. He was born in South
Carolina and had earned an AB from Harvard in 1921 and an MA from Columbia
in 1923. Since his work as a technical writer with AT&T required a move to New
York, Mildred Dean discontinued her course work at Johns Hopkins. She continued
her graduate work by taking a full-time program at Columbia University from the
summer of 1927 through the spring of 1928. She also continued to work on her
dissertation, mainly on her own, with occasional visits to Baltimore for discussions
with Morley. She took her oral examination at Johns Hopkins in January 1929
and received her doctorate in February with subordinate subjects chemistry and
geological physics.

From 1929 until 1963, Charles E. Dean worked as a technical writer and editor for
the Hazeltine Corporation in Little Neck, Queens, New York. During that period,
the Deans raised a family, and Mildred Dean had various teaching positions in
the New York area. A son, Robert Waters, was born in 1929, and a daughter,
Margaret Lewis, was born in 1932. Mildred Dean taught part time at Brooklyn
College 1931–33, at Queens College 1942–47, and at Adelphi College 1947–48. She
was a temporary instructor at Hunter College, taught at Hofstra, and in 1971
reported that she had retired from her last position at Queens.

In 1963 the Deans moved to the Washington, D.C., area, where Mildred Dean
participated in the Forum for Professionals and Executives, a study group, and
volunteered for Travellers Aid in Union Station and in the accounting oﬃce for the
American Cancer Society.

Having suﬀered from heart and lung ailments for some time, Mildred Waters
Dean died at her home in Takoma Park, Maryland, at seventy-seven in 1981. She
was survived by her sister, husband, children, and grandchildren. She is buried in
Monocacy Cemetery in Beallsville, Maryland.
