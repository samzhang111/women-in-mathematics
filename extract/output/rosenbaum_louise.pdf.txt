ROSENBAUM, Louise (Johnson). January 21, 1908–January 16, 1980.
University of Colorado (BA 1928, MA 1933, PhD 1939).

Laura Louise Johnson was born in Carrollton, Illinois, the youngest of ﬁve chil-
dren of Ida Jane (Taylor) (1868–ca. 1940) and William Foster Johnson (1868–ca.
1939) of Illiniois. Her parents married in Illinois in June 1892, and all of their chil-
dren were born there. They were Minnie E. (1893–1980), Mildred M. (1894–1983),
Viola C. (1897–1970), Ebert Taylor (1899–1949), and Laura Louise, who was known
as Louise. The family moved from Illinois to a farm outside of Boulder, Colorado,
in about 1918, when Louise Johnson was ten. She attended country school through
grade nine and at age thirteen moved by herself into Boulder in order to attend a
school that oﬀered a stronger preparatory program.

After completing high school at sixteen, Johnson entered the University of Col-
orado, where she did all of her undergraduate and graduate work. Burton W. Jones
and Robert A. Rosenbaum recalled that her ﬁnancial resources for her undergrad-
uate work consisted of ﬁfty dollars from her parents and her salary from a job as a
checker in the university cafeteria during all her years as an undergraduate. They
also reported that “she might have majored in geology if she could have aﬀorded
the laboratory and ﬁeld trip fees” (Jones and Rosenbaum, 17).

Louise Johnson taught in high schools in eastern Colorado for two years after
receiving her bachelor’s degree in 1928. In May 1930 she was enumerated as a
high school teacher in Armel in Yuma County. That autumn she returned to the
University of Colorado and began her graduate studies working as an assistant in
mathematics for at least two years and as an instructor in the extension division
of the university most of the rest of the time she was there. “For administrative
reasons, she was always described as a ‘part-timer’, even during those (rare) quarters
when she taught 17 or 18 hours per week, the full-time load being 16 hours. With
scrupulous attention, [Aubrey] Kempner saw to it that she received more than a
full-time salary on such occasions” (Jones and Rosenbaum, 17). One year in the
early 1930s she also taught mathematics at a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)
camp, a considerable distance from Boulder. Johnson received her master’s degree in
1933 after completing a thesis directed by Kempner, who also directed her doctoral
dissertation in number theory. Paul Erd¨os wrote the review of the article based on
her dissertation for the Mathematical Reviews and “became a good friend because
of his interest in [her] results” (Rosenbaum correspondence 1998).

Johnson received one of two PhD’s awarded in mathematics by Colorado in 1939.
The other went to Marjorie Beaty. They were the fourth and ﬁfth doctorates given
in mathematics at Colorado since the ﬁrst in 1906; the sixth was not awarded until
1951.

After Johnson ﬁnished her work for the PhD, “she was told by Kempner that
there was really no future for her in Boulder since two of the four professorial
members of the department were women” (Jones and Rosenbaum, 18). One of the
women was Claribel Kendall, an associate professor and native of Colorado who
had received a PhD from the University of Chicago in 1921. The other was Frances
Stribic, an assistant professor who had completed all her work for a PhD except for
her dissertation.

In the fall of 1939 Johnson was one of four fellows who had gone to Reed College
in Portland, Oregon, to participate in a mathematics teaching seminar sponsored by

the General Education Board and run by Reed’s Professor F. L. Griﬃn. One of the
other teaching fellows that year was Robert A. Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum, who was
born in 1915 in New Haven, Connecticut, shortly after his father, Joseph Rosen-
baum, had earned a PhD in mathematics from Cornell, had earned his bachelor’s
degree from Yale in 1936. He had spent the year 1936–37 as a fellow of the Henry
Fund in Cambridge. After the 1939–40 academic year both Johnson and Rosen-
baum stayed on at Reed as instructors. They were married on August 1, 1942. R.
A. Rosenbaum spent the next three years in the navy, while Louise Rosenbaum
remained at Reed College, as instructor until 1943 and then as assistant professor
after 1943. While he was a naval aviator in the Paciﬁc, she “continued to teach at
Reed, carrying a particularly heavy load in a military pre-meteorology program”
(Jones and Rosenbaum, 18). She apparently did not spend the entire war years in
Oregon, since she reported an address in Hollywood, Florida, in the 1944 MAA
membership list. In F. L. Griﬃn’s 1969 reminiscences he noted that when “the war
was over . . . Reed got our Bob and Louise Rosenbaum back, a great day for Reed”
(466).

Robert Rosenbaum returned to Reed as assistant professor in 1945–46. He ﬁn-
ished his PhD from Yale in 1947, returned to Reed as associate professor in the
fall of 1947, and was promoted to professor in 1949. In 1950–51 he was a visiting
professor at Swarthmore College. Louise and Robert Rosenbaum remained on the
faculty at Reed until 1953, when Robert Rosenbaum joined the faculty at Wes-
leyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, as professor of mathematics. He later
became dean of science, provost, academic vice president and provost, and acting
president. In 1985 he was named University Professor of Mathematics and the Sci-
ences, emeritus. During 1958–59 he was an NSF fellow at the Mathematics Institute
at Oxford.

The Rosenbaums had three sons: Robert Johnson, Joseph Griﬃn, and David
William, born in 1943, 1946, and 1948, respectively. Jones and Rosenbaum report
that while the Rosenbaums were at Reed “despite the duties of a growing family . . .
there was no semester during which Louise did not teach at least one course” (18).
They add that she also directed “notable undergraduate theses” and served on ma-
jor college committees. After the Rosenbaums moved to Connecticut permanently
in 1953, Louise Rosenbaum’s regular teaching stopped. She had occasional visiting
appointments at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut College in New London,
and was a visiting faculty member at Smith College in 1973–74 when Robert Rosen-
baum was a visiting professor at the nearby University of Massachusetts. She also
was a professor at Saint Joseph College in West Hartford. She stayed active in
mathematics education, serving on a committee of the School Mathematics Study
Group (SMSG) and directing summer institutes for teachers in Connecticut and
Oregon. During the 1950s and 1960s, she and her husband published, and revised
several times, a pamphlet listing books appropriate for high school libraries. She
also wrote a short book on mathematical induction.

Chief among Louise Rosenbaum’s interests was hiking. While at Colorado she
helped to arrange and guide tours of students into the mountains by bus or back-
packing and climbed many of the high peaks of Colorado. She was also an expert
skier, who skied in Colorado, Oregon, and Europe. Her husband reported that she
became a member of the Society of Friends, “ﬁnding its philosophy, values, and
social concerns particularly appealing” (Rosenbaum correspondence 1998).
