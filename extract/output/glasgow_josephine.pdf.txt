GLASGOW, Josephine (Burns). July 22, 1887–January 22, 1969.
University of Illinois (BA 1909, MA 1911, PhD 1913).

Josephine Elizabeth Burns was born in Greenville, Illinois, the daughter of Ida
Jane (Carey) (1856–1929) of Ohio and James Clinton Burns (1850–1930) of Penn-
sylvania. Her father graduated in 1875 from Monmouth College, had a master’s
degree, and was later a professor of history at the Western Illinois State Normal
School (now Western Illinois University) at Macomb. Her parents, who were col-
lege classmates, were married in 1878, and there were four children in the family:
Clinton (1880–1939); Deane, born March 1884; Josephine; and Ruth, born August
1890. Deane and Ruth received bachelor’s degrees from Illinois in 1907 and 1911,
respectively. Deane Burns became a chemical engineer, and Clinton Burns was a
retired executive of Standard Oil Company in China at the time of his death.

Josephine Burns prepared in the Monmouth and Macomb high schools and at-
tended Western Illinois State Normal School 1904–06, shortly after it was estab-
lished at the turn of the century and before it granted degrees. As an undergraduate
at the University of Illinois she was a member of the Illiola Literary Society for
women and the education honor society Kappa Delta Pi. Burns graduated in 1909,
having earned Final Honors.

Josephine Burns remained at Illinois as a graduate student and held a mathe-
matics scholarship in 1910–11. After earning her master’s degree in 1911, she held a
fellowship in mathematics at the University of Wisconsin 1911–12 and at the Uni-
versity of Illinois 1912–13. She received her PhD from Illinois in 1913. Her work in
group theory for her master’s thesis and her doctoral dissertation at Illinois resulted
in a historical paper in the Monthly and a paper in the American Journal of Mathe-
matics. For several years after its publication, her paper in the Monthly was among
those listed when the editors publicized the historical papers they had published.
Her PhD dissertation was directed by G. A. Miller, and it is likely that Miller, who
had come to Illinois in 1906, also directed her master’s thesis. Her critical reading
of the page proofs of Miller’s contribution to Miller, Blichfeldt, and Dickson’s 1916
Theory and Applications of Finite Groups was acknowledged in the preface of that
book.

Burns remained at Illinois as instructor 1913–15, 1918–20, ﬁrst semester 1924–25,
and 1925–26. On June 15, 1916, in Macomb, she married Robert Douglass Glasgow.
Glasgow, born in Tennessee, Illinois, on April 3, 1879, had earned a BA in 1908
and a PhD in 1913 in entomology at the University of Illinois. He also remained at
Illinois after obtaining his doctorate: as instructor 1913–24 and as associate 1924–
28. While a student he served as a ﬁrst lieutenant and a captain in the University
Regiment and later served as a brevet (temporary) captain in the Illinois National
Guard.

While the Glasgows were still at Illinois, Josephine B. Glasgow and Mary Gertrude
Haseman, who was instructor there 1920–28, prepared a mimeographed freshman
mathematics text. This work is likely to have formed the basis for the paper they
read in 1926 to the Illinois Section of the MAA.

In 1928 Robert D. Glasgow took a position as state entomologist for New York,
so they moved to Albany where they remained. In this position he was involved
with pest control and later was particularly active in the Mosquito Control Associ-
ation. Also in 1928, Josephine Burns Glasgow served as national secretary of Sigma

Delta Epsilon and represented that society in the council of the AAAS. While in Al-
bany, she was active in the AAUW and in 1932 represented the state AAUW when
the state Women’s Joint Legislative Forum was organized. She became secretary-
treasurer of the state AAUW in 1940, vice president of the North Atlantic region
in 1947, and was appointed to the national board of directors as vice president in
1952. In 1951 the Albany branch named a fellowship in her honor.

The Glasgows had no children. They were particularly knowledgeable about ferns
and mushrooms, and in the summer of 1954 Josephine Glasgow led one day of a
six-day ﬁeld trip organized by the American Fern Society.

Robert Glasgow retired in 1949, having reached the mandatory retirement age
of seventy. He then served as a consultant to a ﬁrm in the Philippines. He died in
Albany on July 15, 1964.

Josephine B. Glasgow died in or near Albany, New York, at age eighty-one in
January 1969. Memorial contributions were to be given to the AAUW scholarship
fund.
