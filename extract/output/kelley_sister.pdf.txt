KELLEY, Sister Mary Gervase. September 8, 1888–October 22, 1926.
Catholic University of America (Catholic Sisters College) (BA 1914, MA
1915, PhD 1917).

Helen Agnes Kelley was born in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, Mas-
sachusetts, the daughter of Mary (Callahan) (b. 1853) and John P. Kelley (b.
1848). According to the 1900 census, her parents were born in Massachusetts of
Irish heritage. At that time her parents had been married sixteen years; the four
surviving children of ﬁve born were: John A. (b. 1886), Helen, Mary E. (b. 1890),
and William G. (b. 1891). John Kelley, her father, was a plumber. Some records
report the last name as Kelly instead of Kelley.

Helen Kelley received her elementary education in St. Patrick’s parochial school
and graduated from St. Patrick’s high school in Roxbury in 1905 . She entered the
community of the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, Halifax, Nova Scotia,
on August 5, 1906, took her ﬁrst vows on November 1, 1908, and her ﬁnal vows on
August 15, 1915. She used the religious name Sister Mary Gervase.

Community records were destroyed in a ﬁre in 1951, so much of the information
about Sister Mary Gervase is based on material that was reconstructed after the
ﬁre. According to these records, Sister Mary Gervase was a teacher in schools run by
her religious community; she earned her “B” License in 1908 and her “A” License
in 1912. According to her dissertation vita, “in 1910 she began work with the
University of London, from which institution she received the Matriculation and
the Intermediate Arts certiﬁcates.”

It appears that Sister Mary Gervase was assigned to St. Mary’s in Halifax 1908–
13, to St. Patrick’s in Roxbury, Massachusetts, 1913–17, and to Mount St. Vincent
in Rockingham, Nova Scotia, 1917–23. In all of these assignments she was either a
teacher or a student.

From 1908 to 1913, Sister Mary Gervase taught in Halifax public schools. From
1913 to 1917, including summer sessions, she was a student in residence at the
Catholic Sisters College of the Catholic University of America, where she earned a
BA in 1914, an MA in 1915, and a PhD in 1917. Her PhD was the ﬁrst in mathe-
matics earned by a woman religious in the United States; the next was awarded a
dozen years later, also by Catholic University, to Sister Marie Cecilia Mangold. Sis-
ter Mary Gervase’s degree was one of the ﬁrst two PhD’s in mathematics awarded by
Catholic University. Both she and J. N. Rice earned degrees in June 1917 under the
direction of Aubrey Landry, and both of their dissertations are available in the Uni-
versity of Michigan Historical Mathematics Collection. While Sister Mary Gervase
returned to Nova Scotia after receiving her doctorate, Rice joined the mathematics
faculty at Catholic and remained there about forty years.

Sister Mary Gervase was a teacher at Mount St. Vincent Academy in Rocking-
ham, Nova Scotia, from 1917 until 1923. In 1923 she entered the Lourdes Sana-
torium in Stellarton, Nova Scotia, as a patient. This tuberculosis sanatorium had
been opened by the Sisters of Charity just over a decade earlier. Sister Mary Ger-
vase remained there until her death at age thirty-eight in 1926. She was survived
by her mother and at least one sister and one brother.
