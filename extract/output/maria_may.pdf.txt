MARIA, May (Hickey). December 16, 1904–June 8, 2001.
Rice Institute (BA 1926, MA 1927, PhD 1929).

Deborah May Hickey was born in Lumberton, Mississippi, the ﬁfth of seven
children of Edna May (Adams) (1873–1955) and Charles Robert Hickey (1874–
1956), both of Alabama. In the early years of her parents’ marriage, her father
farmed in Alabama, where the ﬁrst four children were born: Charles Middleton
(1897–1991), Thomas Earl (1899–1984), Ernest Pleasanton (1900–1993), and Mary
Ruth (1902–1990). The family lived in Mississippi when Deborah May and Maude
Isabel (1907–1954) were born; by 1910 the family had moved to Dallas, Texas, where
May Hickey’s father was working as a laborer. The youngest daughter, Martha
Louise (1911–1980), was born in Deport, Texas.

When May Hickey was in the seventh grade, the family moved to Houston so
the children could attend Rice Institute (now Rice University), which provided
tuition-free education to white residents of Houston until its charter was modiﬁed
in 1963. While there, her father, who had not attended high school, worked for an
oil reﬁnery, an automobile assembly plant, and then the railroad. Her mother, who
had attended high school and worked in dressmaking and millinery, took a course in
stenography and became a secretary. May Hickey Maria recalled in 1992 that much
of her education occurred at home; for example, her mother frequently read aloud
to the children, Charles Dickens being among the selections. May, who had always
liked mathematics, and her sisters went to public high school in Houston Heights. All
seven children eventually attended Rice, earning altogether six bachelor’s degrees,
one master’s degree, and one PhD from that university, and two master’s degrees
from other universities. Her brothers became engineers, two sisters were teachers,
and one did clerical work in a bank.

May Hickey graduated as valedictorian from Houston Heights High School be-
fore entering Rice Institute in 1922. She was named a Hohenthal scholar after her
ﬁrst year and received the Graham Baker student award in 1924. She graduated
from Rice in 1926 with honors in mathematics. She continued to study, as a fel-
low, the next three years in the graduate school there. Hickey earned her master’s
degree with honors in mathematics and physics in 1927, and a paper based on her
thesis appeared in the Annals of Mathematics in 1929. When she was awarded
her doctorate in 1929, she became the ﬁrst woman to earn a PhD in any ﬁeld at
Rice. The published version of her dissertation appeared in the American Journal
of Mathematics in 1932.

Hickey spent the year 1929–30 in Munich as a holder of the Alice Freeman Palmer
fellowship of the AAUW, for which she received $1600. She went there speciﬁcally
to study with Constantin Carath´eodory whom she had ﬁrst met at Rice and whose
lectures she had heard at the University of California in Berkeley in the summer of
1928. While at Munich she took two courses with Carath´eodory and participated in
a seminar during the spring semester. She also traveled alone to Italy on a vacation
while in Europe that year.

When May Hickey returned from Munich she took a position as professor of
mathematics at Delta State Teachers College in Cleveland, Mississippi, replacing
Julia Dale, who had been chairman of the department before leaving in 1930. Hickey
remained as professor and chairman in the one- or two-person department at Delta

State until 1938. During that period two of her mathematics research papers ap-
peared, and she prepared a chapter for a Mississippi Department of Education
publication on improvement of instruction.

On June 2, 1938, Deborah May Hickey married Alfred Joseph Maria (December
4, 1896–June 14, 1964). Maria, a native of Norfolk, Virginia, graduated with a BS
in chemical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1922. He
received a fellowship to Rice that fall and received a master’s degree in 1923 and
a PhD in 1925 in mathematics from Rice Institute. May Hickey was a student of
his in both her freshman and junior years at Rice. Early in his career A. J. Maria
taught at Rice, the University of Illinois, and Duke; he held an NSF fellowship
abroad; he was a research fellow at Princeton; and he spent a year at the Institute
for Advanced Study.

After their marriage May Hickey and Alfred J. Maria spent some time in Houston
and then in Norfolk, Virginia, with his parents. In the summer of 1939, May Maria
taught at the State Teachers College in Radford, Virginia. In 1939 they moved
to New York City where both eventually became aﬃliated with Brooklyn College.
Albert J. Maria ﬁrst obtained a temporary appointment as tutor; he began in the
day session in spring 1939 and had continuous employment at Brooklyn College
after that. He was an instructor 1939–47, assistant professor from 1947 to about
1956, and then associate professor. Because of a brain tumor, he was on leave in
the spring semester before his death in June 1964.

May Hickey Maria was an instructor in the evening session 1939–41 and in the
summer session 1940–45 at Brooklyn College. She was a substitute in the day
session 1941–42 when someone left for war-related work. She was an instructor
at Queens College 1942–43. Her regular appointment at Brooklyn began after the
war when she was an instructor 1946–55 and received tenure in 1948. She was an
assistant professor 1955–62 and an associate professor 1962–75; she never applied
for promotion to full professor. Both May Hickey and Albert J. Maria taught in
summer school in the earlier years. He also taught in the division of graduate studies
his entire time at Brooklyn as did she from the mid-1950s. Her 1958 book on an
axiomatic development of arithmetic and algebra was used in a course designed
to satisfy the school’s mathematics requirement. In summer 1959 she taught in an
NSF institute for high school teachers at Arizona State University. While living
in New York she was a regular attendee of regional meetings of the AMS and the
Metropolitan New York Section meetings of the MAA, the latter starting with its
organizational meeting in 1941. When she was teaching at Delta State she had
attended meetings of the Louisiana-Mississippi Section of the MAA and served as
secretary 1932–33.

After her retirement in 1975 May Maria continued to live in her apartment
a few blocks from Brooklyn College, where she had lived since 1941. She was a
member of the Church of the Nativity, an Episcopal church in Brooklyn. In 1992
she was planning to move to Texas and did so the following year. She then lived at
Westminster Manor, a retirement home in Austin.

May Maria died at Seton Medical Center in Austin in 2001. She was ninety-
six. She was survived by a dozen nieces and nephews and was buried in Austin
Memorial Park. The obituary notes that “throughout her life, she inspired others
by her unshakable integrity and optimism, her independent spirit, and her lifelong
passion for learning.”
