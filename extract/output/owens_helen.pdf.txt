OWENS, Helen (Brewster). April 2, 1881–June 6, 1968.
University of Kansas (BA 1900, MA 1901), Cornell University (PhD 1910).

Helen Barten Brewster was born in Pleasanton, Linn County, Kansas, the only
child of Clara (Linton) (1850–1933), originally of Ohio, and Robert Edward Brew-
ster (b. ca. 1840), a native of New York. In 1880 her parents were living in Linn
County, where her father, a Civil War veteran, was a farmer. Her parents had
married in about 1880, and it appears her father died in 1892.

Helen Brewster did her college preparation in three years at the Pleasanton High
School and entered the University of Kansas in Lawrence in September 1897, when
she was sixteen. In the 1900 census she was enumerated with her widowed mother,
a school teacher, and with her maternal grandmother in Pleasanton. She and her
mother were enumerated a second time in 1900 as boarders in Lawrence, where she
was a student.

Helen B. Brewster earned her bachelor’s degree from Kansas in 1900 and her
master’s degree in 1901. The following year she was a teaching fellow at Kansas
and published an article, possibly her master’s thesis, in which she expressed her
gratitude to Henry B. Newson, the husband of Mary Winston Newson. In a letter
of January 31, 1936, she wrote to “Mrs. Newson” that “through all these years you
and your husband have been vital inﬂuences in our lives” (transcription in authors’
possession). Brewster continued her graduate studies at the University of Kansas
until June 1903 and taught high school in Lawrence from 1902 until 1904.

On June 22, 1904, in Pleasanton, Kansas, Helen Brewster married Frederick
William Owens, who had also studied mathematics with H. B. Newson at the Uni-
versity of Kansas. F. W. Owens was born in Rockwell City, Iowa, on November
18, 1880. He received a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree from Kansas in
1902 and remained as a teaching fellow 1902–03. During 1903–05 he was a resi-
dent graduate student in mathematics and astronomy at the University of Chicago.
Helen B. Owens studied at the University of Chicago in the summer and autumn
quarters of 1904. Their ﬁrst daughter, Helen Brewster, was born in May 1905 in Illi-
nois. F. W. Owens taught at the academy of Northwestern University in Evanston,
Illinois, 1905–07, and Helen Owens returned to high school teaching in 1906 and
taught through 1907 in Evanston. In 1907 F. W. Owens received his PhD from the
University of Chicago and took a position as instructor of mathematics at Cor-
nell University in Ithaca, New York. Their second daughter, Clara Brewster, was
born in February 1908. Helen Owens enrolled as a graduate student at Cornell the
following academic year and received her PhD in 1910 with a dissertation written
under the direction of Virgil Snyder. She presented minors in physics with Ernest
Merritt and mathematical physics with James McMahon.

Helen Owens worked as a private teacher of mathematics in Ithaca for several
years starting in 1908 and taught at Wells College, a women’s college in Aurora,
about thirty miles from Ithaca, on two occasions. She was an instructor at Wells
second semester 1914–15 and an acting assistant professor second semester 1916–17.
In the ﬁrst term of 1916–17 she successfully completed a Cornell graduate course,
Clothing 16, a sewing course that would have been oﬀered by the home economics
department of the Cornell College of Agriculture.

From 1911 to 1917 Owens also campaigned for women’s suﬀrage in Kansas and
in New York State. Owens was a state organizer for the Kansas Equal Suﬀrage

Association during the successful campaign of 1911–12. A newspaper article based
on an interview with Owens in 1960 reported that “her ﬁrst interest in women’s
suﬀrage started, when, as a small child, she accompanied her mother, [who was]
president of the Linn County Women’s Suﬀrage Assn. in Kansas, to the County
Fair” (“Women Voters to Mark 40th”). She also said that at the fair she helped
distribute copies of a photograph of the temperance leader, Frances Willard, that
had been taken with “her ‘political peers,’ the disenfranchised men, including ma-
niacs, condemned criminals, idiots and such.” In 1911 her mother was invited to
Kansas to lecture on women’s suﬀrage; Helen Owens went instead. In a 1943 article
on the Kansas suﬀrage campaign, it was reported that “Dr. Helen Brewster Owens,
a Kansas girl living in New York, oﬀered to pay her way to Kansas and give eight
weeks of her time to the work, providing her expenses in the state were paid. She
came in November and proved a most eﬃcient organizer. The next year she re-
turned and was paid by the national association” (“The woman suﬀrage campaign
of 1912,” 304). The article credits the help of out-of-state workers for the successful
campaign. In particular, Owens “remained as a ﬁeld organizer until the last of July
[1912] when overcome by heat, she went home for a month’s rest. Returning the
following September, she worked unceasingly until the election” (p. 312). After her
experience in Kansas, Owens continued her work for women’s suﬀrage in New York
State as a district chairman of the Empire State Campaign Committee 1913–15
while Carrie Chapman Catt was president of the state organization. Although the
1915 referendum was unsuccessful, Owens remained active in the state campaign
until women in New York won the right to vote in 1917.

She wrote for her entry in J. W. Leonard’s 1914 Woman’s Who’s Who of America
that she was “interested in various organizations for civic improvement and high
ideals” (p. 615). She included her presidencies of the Political Study Club of Ithaca
and the Tompkins County Equal Suﬀrage Association, as well as memberships in
the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, the Civic Improvement League, and the
Cornell Consumers’ League.

Helen Owens was an instructor at Cornell University 1917–1922, where she
taught such courses as advanced algebra, advanced analytic geometry, calculus, dif-
ferential equations, and projective geometry. Owens also sometimes served as the
faculty advisor to the Cornell mathematics club that was organized in November
1919. During the years 1908 to 1926 she was intermittently employed as a secondary
school teacher and as a private tutor, and in 1922 she was the ﬁrst national treasurer
of Sigma Delta Epsilon (now Sigma Delta Epsilon-Graduate Women in Science), a
fraternal order for graduate women in science founded at Cornell in 1921.

In 1926 F. W. Owens assumed the headship of the mathematics department
at Pennsylvania State College (now Pennsylvania State University) in State Col-
lege. After their move to Pennsylvania, Helen Owens returned to Ithaca for private
tutoring for three months each academic year until 1928.

In the letter of January 31, 1936, to Mary Winston Newson, Helen Owens re-
counts a number of events in her life and describes some aspects of her current
situation. She noted that both of her daughters graduated from Cornell, but then
recounted “crushing blows.” First, her elder daughter, Helen, had died in 1928. “I
still ﬁnd myself unreconciled and incapable of talking about it.” Newspaper ac-
counts at the time indicate that, according to friends, Helen, a medical student
at the University of Chicago, drank poison, partly out of despair over her desire

to marry, which was in conﬂict with her parents’ wishes that she wait until she
ﬁnished medical school, and partly because of her lack of success in some of her
courses. The younger daughter, Clara, married a medical school classmate in June
1930, and both received their MD degrees from Cornell University Medical College
and became parents of a son in June 1931. Owens continued her description of
the “crushing blows” to include the December 1931 death of Clara’s husband as
a result of a staphylococci infection caused when he “nipped a tiny pimple on his
upper lip in shaving.” Clara began her residency in New York the following month
while Helen and Frederick Owens cared for her son. After beginning her practice in
State College in October 1933, Clara and her young son, continued to live in the
Owens household until at least sometime in 1936. Helen Owens also related that
her mother, who had lived with them for twenty-six years, had died in the spring
of 1933.

Helen Owens then moved on to happier topics in her letter and described her
teaching and tutoring before her eldest daughter’s death. She also noted in the
margin, “I see I did not explain – a state ruling makes it impossible for two members
of same family to teach at same school.” She wrote that she would regularly get
together with the women in the Penn State mathematics department, Teresa Cohen,
Beatrice Hagen, and Aline Huke Frink, and read mathematical textbooks; they had
read Sierpinski’s Introduction to General Topology and were then reading Harold
Hilton’s Plane Algebraic Curves.

In 1934 Helen B. and F. W. Owens took a trip that included visits to all forty-
eight states as well as Mexico and Canada. In March they stopped in Topeka,
Kansas, to attend a meeting of the Kansas Section of the MAA. The report of
the meeting noted that they “were passing through Kansas on their way to a six
months’ rest in California” (Amer. Math. Monthly 41:405). Other mathematics
meetings they attended that year were an AMS meeting in June in Berkeley, Cali-
fornia, the AMS and MAA summer meetings in Williamstown, Massachusetts, an
AMS meeting in October in New York City, and the annual December AMS and
MAA meetings in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They had been attending the summer
meetings every year since 1929, and from 1934 until the United States entered World
War II in December 1941 they attended an average of two other AMS meetings a
year.

From 1935 to 1938 Helen Owens was an associate editor of the American Math-
ematical Monthly and edited the Mathematical Clubs section with her husband.
During the late 1930s she formed a committee for the study of women’s work in
mathematics; she corresponded with various institutions and organizations and sent
questionnaires to those North American women she was able to identify as holding
PhD’s in mathematics. At the summer mathematics meetings of 1937 in State Col-
lege, she organized a luncheon honoring women pioneers in mathematical research
in America. R. G. D. Richardson, then secretary of the AMS, suggested that she
prepare a talk on her ﬁndings to be given to the MAA and a paper for inclusion
in the Monthly. Although that presentation was never made, she did circulate a
second round of questionnaires in 1940 and, at about that time, gave a speech,
most likely at a meeting of Sigma Delta Epsilon, “Early Scientiﬁc Work of Women
and Women in Mathematics.” Correspondence, completed questionnaires, a copy of
the talk, and other materials related to her study of women’s work in mathematics

are in her papers at the Schlesinger Library. Notes for, and a draft of, a book on
women in mathematics and science are also listed as being in these papers.

Several of the letters in Owens’ papers at the Schlesinger Library indicate that
she was much appreciated by other women mathematicians. For example, on Feb-
ruary 4, 1937, Sister Mary Felice Vaudreuil wrote about the 1936 summer meetings:
“We Sisters appreciated very much your kind friendliness toward us at the Boston
meeting. I can well understand that most people do not know what to make of us so
we appreciate the more the friendliness of those who are kind to us. Such meetings
are a very great inspiration and I like to attend them in spite of the fact that my
dress seems out of place.” Later, on May 22, 1940, Ruth Mason Ballard wrote to
Owens that “you were so kind to me . . . when I was homeless and jobless, that you
have a very special place in my regard.”

In 1940 Helen Owens was hired as an instructor by Pennsylvania State College
and was promoted to assistant professor in 1945. Both she and her husband retired
in 1949, she as assistant professor emeritus and he as professor emeritus. They were
living in State College at the time of the death of F. W. Owens on June 23, 1961.
She lived the last three years of her life at the home of her surviving daughter, a
physician at the Newton D. Baker Veterans Hospital in Martinsburg, West Virginia.
Helen B. Owens died in Martinsburg in 1968 at age eighty-seven. In her 1936 letter
to Mary Newson she had expressed her preference for cremation. She was survived
by her daughter and ﬁve grandchildren.
