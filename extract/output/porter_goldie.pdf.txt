PORTER, Goldie (Horton). September 4, 1887–May 11, 1972.
University of Texas (BA 1908, PhD 1916), Smith College (MA 1910).

Goldie Printis Horton was the youngest of three surviving daughters, of four
children born, of Colistia (Polk) (b. 1861), a Texas native, and John Thomas Horton
(b. 1857), originally from Missouri. Her parents married in about 1881. She was born
in 1887 in Athens, Texas, and her older sisters were Mary Coral (1882–1967) and
Lillian Pearl (b. 1885). Her father was a physician, and in 1900 and 1910 the family
lived in Quanah, Texas, just below the southeastern part of the Texas panhandle.
Goldie Horton attended public schools in Quanah before entering the University
of Texas in 1904. While at the university she was secretary-treasurer of her senior
class and was a member of the YWCA. She graduated from Texas in 1908 before her
twenty-ﬁrst birthday. Her sister Pearl also received a BA from Texas in 1908 and
was a public school teacher for some time after her graduation. Her eldest sister,
Coral, studied at the University of Texas, taught school, married, and then earned a
BA in 1924 and an MA in 1927 from Texas. Coral was a member of the University
of Texas history department until her retirement in 1959 as assistant professor;
she was associated with the Texas State Historical Association as corresponding
secretary 1927-42 and corresponding secretary and treasurer 1942–67.

After receiving her bachelor’s degree, Goldie Horton taught in the high school
in Grandview, Texas, for a year before going to Smith College in Northampton,
Massachusetts, with a fellowship in 1909. Records at Smith show that on October
11, 1909, Horton was made an honorary member of the mathematics club of the
college, and on March 14, 1910, she gave a talk to the club on “Motion of Aggregate
Points.” She completed her master’s thesis, “The development of analysis,” in May
1910 and returned to Texas, where she taught at the high school in Amarillo for
the next two years, 1910–12. Horton then studied at Bryn Mawr College as a fellow
1912–13.

In 1913 Goldie Horton was hired as a tutor at Texas. She also continued her
graduate work and in 1916 completed the work for her PhD with a dissertation in
analysis written under the direction of M. B. Porter; the approval sheet was also
signed by H. J. Ettlinger and E. L. Dodd. Horton wrote in the dissertation: “I
take the greatest pleasure in expressing my deep appreciation of the ready counsel
and invaluable assistance given me by Professor Milton Brockett Porter, who for
many years has been my teacher and friend and whose kind interest inspired me to
continue my studies.” This was the ﬁrst doctoral degree in mathematics awarded
at Texas. She was also the ﬁrst woman to receive a PhD in any ﬁeld at Texas.

Goldie Horton remained a tutor until 1917 when she was promoted to instructor
in pure mathematics; in 1926 she was promoted to adjunct professor and in 1935
to assistant professor. According to Robert E. Greenwood’s “In Memoriam,” in the
summer of 1921 she worked on the preparation of ballistic tables at the Aberdeen
Proving Ground in Maryland. Her parents were still living in Quanah in 1920, but
Goldie Horton and her widowed mother were living together in Austin in 1930.

In 1934 Horton and Milton Brockett Porter, her colleague and dissertation advi-
sor of eighteen years earlier, had notes for a text reproduced by Edwards Brothers
of Ann Arbor, Michigan, a company that often produced lithographs of lecture
notes. On December 26 of that year she and Porter were married. This was the
third marriage for M. B. Porter, who had been twice widowed. Milton Brockett

Porter was born on November 22, 1869, in Sherman, Texas. He received a BS in
1892 from the University of Texas and an MA in 1895 and a PhD in 1897 from
Harvard University. After working as a private tutor in Texas and teaching at the
University of Texas and at Yale University, he returned in 1902 as professor in pure
mathematics to the University of Texas, where he remained until his retirement in
1945. M. B. Porter died in Austin on May 27, 1960.

Goldie Porter, still an assistant professor, stopped teaching full time and went
on modiﬁed service in 1958. She continued part-time teaching until her retirement
in 1966, when she was granted the title professor emeritus. Goldie Horton Porter
was active in various organizations in Texas, particularly before she married. In
1919 she served as chair of the mathematics section of the Texas State Teachers’
Association. She served as an oﬃcer of, gave talks to, and hosted parties for The
Pentagram, the mathematics club at the university. Furthermore, she was a founder,
in 1920, of the University of Texas chapter of Alpha Phi, a social sorority, and in
1923, of the Austin chapter of AAUW, which she also served as treasurer, secretary,
and president. In the late 1930s she described herself as a Democrat and indicated
interests in gardening and housekeeping.

In 1930 Goldie Horton and her mother, then almost seventy years old, had a
house built in Austin where the Porters lived after their marriage. Greenwood
noted:

It soon became a misnomer to refer to the establishment as only
a residence. It also became a library and a museum. Though both
the Porters were avid readers they were obliged to curtail their
acquisition of books only when they had no more place to store
them. The Porters were lovers of music as well. Dr. M. B. Porter
was an accomplished ﬂutist, and Goldie served as his accompanist
at the frequent informal musicales.

An amateur astronomer, Professor M. B. Porter had a small
telescope at the Porter Museum and a sundial placed in the gar-
dens. Both the Porters were notable collectors – of cut glass, silver,
oriental and European porcelains, oriental rugs, ivories, art glass,
pictures, objets d’art in general, many of museum quality. After the
Porters’ heirs had selected various pieces from the estate, such a
vast collection remained that a two-day auction attracted a large
audience, for the Porter collection was well-known for its coverage
and depth. Indeed, the spirited bidding for the rare Meissen ﬁg-
urines, the Daum, Tiﬀany, and Gall´e glass, and the antique furni-
ture demonstrated the Porters’ acuteness as collectors. (Greenwood,
“In Memoriam”)

Goldie Porter remained in Austin and died in her home in 1972 at eighty-four.
She was survived by two nieces, a nephew, and two stepdaughters and was buried
in Austin Memorial Park. Her Austin home, the Horton-Porter House, was built in
the Spanish Colonial Revival style and is listed in the National Register of Historic
Places; it is on Windsor Road in the Old West Austin Historic District. Greenwood
noted that among her bequests was one to the Texas governor’s mansion of “a large
Meissen group originally wrought in 1760 for German Royalty.” She also endowed
the Goldie Horton Porter Book Fund at Bryn Mawr College.
