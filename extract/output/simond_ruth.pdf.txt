SIMOND, Ruth G. March 7, 1904–September 15, 1958.
Boston University (BA 1927, MA 1929), University of Michigan (PhD 1938).

Ruth Gertrude Simond was the youngest of four surviving children, of ﬁve born,
of Grace M. (Fiﬁeld) (1872–1967) and Walter A. Simond (1871–1962), both natives
of New Hampshire who married in 1892. She was born in Franklin, New Hampshire.
According to census records, in 1900 her father was a knitter of hosiery (a common
occupation in Franklin at that time); he was described in 1910 as foreman of a
hosiery mill, in 1920 as a draftsman in a machine shop, and in 1930 as a machinist
in a hosiery mill. Her mother taught vocal and instrumental music. Her siblings
were Flora (1894–1954), Maurice (1898–1990), and Marion (1901-1997).

Simond grew up in Franklin and presumably attended school there. She entered
Boston University in 1923 and graduated in 1927. After receiving her bachelor’s
degree, she entered the Boston University graduate school, where she took courses
in astrophysics, physical chemistry, and celestial mechanics as well as topics in
advanced mathematics, curve tracing and graphical computation, the constructions
of plane geometry, advanced calculus, and a survey of mathematics for teachers of
elementary and secondary schools. It appears that she took one course in summer
1927, one in 1927–28, and the rest in 1928–29. She received her master’s degree in
June 1929 with a thesis on using graphic calculation in physical chemistry.

Simond was employed for the next four years. She classiﬁed mathematics books
for the Harvard library during 1929–30. The next year she was an instructor at
Hampton Institute (now Hampton University), one of the historically black colleges
and universities in Virginia; it was called Hampton Normal and Agricultural Insti-
tute until 1930. She was a teacher at the Gorham (Maine) Normal School 1931–32
and returned to Hampton Institute as instructor for the school year 1932–33.

Ruth Simond began her graduate work at the University of Michigan in the
summer of 1933 and was registered for courses throughout the academic years and
summers until 1937. She was taking courses part time during the regular academic
years 1934–35 through 1936–37. Her dissertation was supervised by W. L. Ayres,
and the PhD degree was awarded in February 1938. Simond was in charge of the
mathematics courses in the correspondence study department of the University of
Michigan extension service 1936–38. During this period, she was among those who
prepared or revised materials for supervised correspondence courses under the aegis
of the Michigan Works Progress Administration (WPA). In 1936 she and one of her
coauthors, Edith R. Schneckburger (PhD University of Michigan 1940), were the
two nominees of the University of Michigan for membership in the AMS.

After leaving Michigan in 1938, Simond returned to Hampton Institute, where
she was associate professor the next four years. She left in 1942, and a notation of
“U.S. Navy Dept.” was a part of her 1942 AMS membership listing. From August
1943 until March 1944, Simond taught in the Army Specialized Training Program
at Heidelberg College in Tiﬃn, Ohio. During that year nearly 250 military men
were added to the regular civilian enrollment of approximately the same number
at the college, although the army required that the military and civilians could
not be in the same classes. The 1944 AMS membership list has only an address in
Baltimore for Simond. It is unclear exactly what Simond was doing during the two
years 1942–43 and 1944–45. According to her obituary Simond was a cryptanalyst
for the Navy Department in Washington during World War II, possibly during

1942–43. Relatives indicate that she also worked as a “Grey Lady” or nurse’s aide
during the war.

From September 1945 to June 1947 Simond was assistant professor at Berea
College in Kentucky. She was originally invited to Berea to teach mathematics to
members of the Navy V-12 unit there. The following year she taught at Morningside
College in Sioux City, Iowa. In 1948 she was appointed assistant professor at the
University of Vermont and State Agricultural College and remained in that position
for the next decade.

Simond lived in Essex Junction, just outside Burlington, Vermont, and belonged
to the Essex Junction Methodist Church. She taught through the spring semester
1958 and died in Burlington of complications from diabetes on September 15, 1958,
at ﬁfty-four. She was survived by her two sisters and her brother. Her body was
interred in Community Cemetery in Franklin, New Hampshire.
