YEATON, Marie M. (Johnson). March 1, 1898–March 19, 1978.
Knox College (BA 1920), University of Iowa (MS 1921), University of Chicago
(PhD 1928).

Marie Mathilda Johnson was born in Galesburg, Illinois, the younger of two children
of Ellen (Olson), born in 1867, and Oscar William Johnson, born in 1866, both natives of
Illinois. Her parents married in 1890, and her brother, Eugene R., was born in September
1892. Her father was proprietor of a grocery store. Marie Johnson attended grammar
school and high school in Galesburg, where the family lived.

Johnson attended Knox College, also in Galesburg, where Helen Calkins, BA Knox
College 1916, was instructor of mathematics 1918–20, and Sally Elizabeth Carlson, MA
University of Minnesota 1918, was instructor of mathematics and physics 1919–20. Johnson
received her BA in 1920 and eight years later became that school’s ﬁrst graduate to receive
a PhD in mathematics (Calkins did not receive her Cornell PhD until 1932). Johnson
studied with H. L. Rietz and E. W. Chittenden at the University of Iowa 1920–21 and
received her master’s degree in 1921 with a major in mathematics and a minor in education.
In 1921 Johnson became an instructor at Lake Forest College in Lake Forest, Illinois.
During the summers of 1922 through 1926 she attended the University of Chicago. Her
last year at Lake Forest, 1925–26, she was assistant professor and acting head of the
department. After leaving Lake Forest she held a fellowship at the University of Chicago
for the year 1926–27 before receiving her doctorate in 1928 having written a dissertation
in the calculus of variations.

In 1927 Johnson accepted an instructorship at Pennsylvania State College but was
released from that contract in order to go to Oberlin College in Ohio as an acting assistant
professor replacing Mary E. Sinclair who was on leave at the University of Miami in Coral
Gables. Johnson’s position became permanent, and she was assistant professor 1928 until
1943, when she was promoted to associate professor. She had a leave of absence during
the academic year 1937–38 and spent the year in residence at the Institute for Advanced
Study in Princeton.

In the fall of 1935, shortly after the MAA formed its Committee on Tests with one
woman member, Clara E. Smith, professor emeritus at Wellesley, Johnson was added to
the committee in order “to assist in the secretarial work of the committee and in the
construction of tests” (“Report of the Committee on Tests” 1940, 290). The report of
the committee speciﬁcally acknowledged Johnson’s contributions in preparing the 1936
tests as well as in compiling questions for the tests for junior college mathematics and for
trigonometry.

On October 27, 1943, Marie Johnson married Chester Henry Yeaton (1886–1970) who
had come to Oberlin as an assistant professor of mathematics in 1921. Chester H. Yeaton
was born in Maine and received his bachelor’s degree at Bowdoin College in 1908. He
received his master’s degree at Harvard in 1909 and his PhD at Chicago in 1915 under
the direction of E. J. Wilczynski. In 1923 Chester H. Yeaton had married Ethel May
Kitch, who held a PhD from Chicago and was on the faculty of Oberlin’s psychology and
philosophy departments before she died in May 1941.

At the time of his marriage to Marie M. Johnson, Chester H. Yeaton was professor of
mathematics. Marie Johnson Yeaton formally resigned from the Oberlin faculty eﬀective
March 1, 1944. In November 1944 she was appointed acting associate professor for the
winter term. She held the position again in the second semester of 1951–52, after which
Chester H. Yeaton retired. He died in Oberlin in 1970 at age eighty-three.

After her marriage Marie M. Yeaton continued her membership in the Oberlin Math-
ematics Club. She had previously served as faculty advisor to the club and in 1940 con-
tributed bibliographies on “Nomographs” (with Dale Leipper) and “Constructions with

compasses alone” to a section on club topics in the Monthly (47:106–7). Yeaton was also a
member of the Oberlin Social Science Club, and for two years she served as the president
of the Beta Gamma chapter of Delta Kappa Gamma, an education honorary society. In
the mid-1940s she was treasurer of the Oberlin branch of the AAUW. In 1939 she reported
that she was a Lutheran and a Republican and listed her favorite hobby as photography
and her favorite recreation as swimming. In the 1960s she was a member of the Button
Club of Wellington.

Marie Yeaton died in Allen Memorial Hospital in Oberlin, Ohio, at age eighty, having
been a resident at the Welcome Nursing Home for the previous ﬁve years. Her only survivor
was Evelyn Yeaton, a sister-in-law living in Elyria, Ohio, about ten miles from Oberlin.
Yeaton was buried in Westwood Cemetery in Oberlin.
