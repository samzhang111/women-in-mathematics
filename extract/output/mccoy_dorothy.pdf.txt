McCOY, Dorothy. August 9, 1903–November 21, 2001.
Baylor University (BA 1925), University of Iowa (MS 1927, PhD 1929).

Dorothy McCoy was born in Waukomis in Oklahoma Territory, four years before
Oklahoma attained statehood. She was the elder of two children of Susan Ellen
(Holmes) (1876–1941) and Stephen Franklin McCoy (1860–1906). Her mother was
born in Kansas but grew up in Lawrence County in southwestern Missouri and
attended a few short terms at a country school. Her father, born in Alabama, was a
farmer who homesteaded in Oklahoma. He had almost no education but did learn
to read and write. Her parents were married in 1902. Her younger brother, Neal
Henry, was born on March 6, 1905.

After Dorothy McCoy’s father died in 1906, her mother and the two young
children moved to Chesapeake in Lawrence County, Missouri, where her mother
still had family. There Dorothy and Neal attended a one-room elementary school
before the family moved to nearby Marionville where the children attended high
school. After Neal skipped the seventh grade, the two of them did almost all of their
further schooling together. Dorothy McCoy wrote in 1985 that her mother was very
ambitious for both her children.

After Dorothy and Neal McCoy graduated from high school in 1921, the family
moved to Waco, Texas, where they both attended Baylor University, a Baptist
school. After they graduated from Baylor with honors in 1925, both taught in
high school for a year in Texas; Dorothy was in Port Arthur. Together they then
began their graduate work at the State University of Iowa, the oﬃcial name of the
University of Iowa, in Iowa City in July 1926. They earned their master’s degrees
a year later and continued with their work for the doctorate. Dorothy McCoy’s
major ﬁeld of study was mathematics with a ﬁrst minor in education and a second
minor in psychology. She wrote her dissertation in topology under the direction of
E. W. Chittenden; Neal’s dissertation was on commutation formulas in the algebra
of quantum mechanics and was also directed by Chittenden. Both Dorothy and
Neal received their doctorates in 1929. While at Iowa Dorothy held a scholarship
for one year, a fellowship for the year 1927–28, and a graduate assistantship during
1928–29, her last year there. Dorothy McCoy was the only woman to receive a
doctorate in mathematics at Iowa before 1940.

Neal McCoy held a National Research fellowship at Princeton for the two years
after receiving his PhD and then joined the faculty at Smith College, where he had
a distinguished career as a researcher and teacher. He was particularly noted as the
author of textbooks in abstract algebra. He retired in 1970.

Immediately after receiving her PhD, Dorothy McCoy went to Belhaven College
in Jackson, Mississippi, as professor and head of the mathematics department.
During her twenty-year tenure there, Belhaven was a women’s college aﬃliated with
the Presbyterian church. While there, she sponsored the Baptist Student Union. In
the summer of 1930 she taught as a visitor at Baylor, while during the summer
quarter of 1931, she attended classes at the University of Chicago as a visiting
PhD. According to her obituary she also studied during a summer at Columbia
University. In 1933 she joined the editorial board of the Mathematics News Letter,
then an independent journal that had been published under the auspices of the
Louisiana-Mississippi Section of the MAA and the Louisiana-Mississippi Branch of
the NCTM until the end of 1931. In 1934 the journal changed its name to National

Mathematics Magazine, and McCoy remained on the board until its last issue under
that name in 1945; in 1947 it resumed publication as Mathematics Magazine. Also
during this time McCoy was active in the Louisiana-Mississippi Section of the MAA.
She served as secretary of the section 1932–37, chairman 1937–38, and vice chairman
for Mississippi 1938–39.

The attraction of teaching in a Baptist college contributed to McCoy’s decision
to move to Wayland Baptist College (now University) in Plainview, Texas, in 1949,
two years after it became a four-year college. She went as professor of mathematics
and chairman of the division of physical and biological sciences. During the aca-
demic year 1953–54, she was a Fulbright professor at Baghdad University in Iraq.
She also attended institutes for college teachers in Boulder, Colorado, during the
summer of 1953; at Vanderbilt University for one summer and a semester; and
at Washington State University. Between 1954 and 1958 she worked one summer
at Patrick Air Force Base in Florida and two summers at the Aberdeen Proving
Ground in Maryland. She also taught one summer at Northwestern State Teacher’s
College (now Northwestern Oklahoma State University) in Alva, Oklahoma. She
was visiting professor at the University of Hawaii in summer 1958 and at Baylor
in summer 1961. Her obituary indicates that she also taught for a summer at the
University of New Mexico. She served on the council of the AAUP in the early
1960s. She remained chairman of the division of physical and biological sciences at
Wayland Baptist until 1972.

In 1975 McCoy retired as distinguished professor emeritus of mathematics. After
her retirement she spent six months as a teacher of children of missionaries in
Malawi in southeastern Africa; a year later she worked for three months at a similar
school in Indonesia. These experiences caused her to found a mission interest group
in Plainview; she remained involved with that group for the remainder of her life.
The Dorothy McCoy lecture series was established in 1980, she received the
Wayland Alumni Association plaque for distinguished service to students in 1982,
and she was given the Roy McClung Service plaque for her concern for foreign
students at Wayland Baptist. In 1999 she was the ﬁrst to receive the Distinguished
Lifetime Service Award from the Association of Former Students. A bust, created
by a former art teacher at Wayland, has been on display at the library. In September
2001 she was one of the ﬁrst two inductees into the Division of Mathematics and
Science hall of honor at Wayland Baptist.

Dorothy McCoy was a Southern Baptist and was active in the First Baptist
Church in Plainview. She had many hobbies over the years, including travel, pho-
tography, and in later years, bird watching. According to her obituary, her travels
included Central America, South America, and India, in addition to her trips to
Iraq and Africa. She maintained her home in Plainview, but continued to visit her
brother, Neal, in Massachusetts until both were well into their nineties. Neal Mc-
Coy died in Northampton on January 4, 2001. According to a communication from
Janet Seright, a friend in Plainview, Dorothy McCoy remained active, drove her
car, and was still involved in church and mission activities until September of that
year.

On September 27, 2001, Wayland Baptist dedicated in Dorothy McCoy’s name
a recently acquired and renovated property to serve as a senior men’s honors dor-
mitory. The day after the dedication she moved from her home to Prairie House

Living Center, an assisted living facility in Plainview, where she died at age ninety-
eight less than two months later. She is buried in Plainview Memorial Park. The
family suggested that memorials be made to the Dorothy McCoy scholarship fund
for mathematics at Wayland Baptist University.
