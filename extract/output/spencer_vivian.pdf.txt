SPENCER, Vivian E. October 27, 1907–September 14, 1980.
Oberlin College (BA 1928, MA 1929), University of Pennsylvania (PhD 1936).

Vivian Eberle Spencer was born in New Castle, Pennsylvania, the elder of two
daughters of Ina M. (Eberle) (b. 1879) and Andrew Berger Spencer (b. 1869), both
of whom were born in Pennsylvania. At the time of the 1910 census her parents had
been married four years, and her maternal grandparents lived with them in New
Castle; ten years later they still lived in New Castle, and her maternal grandmother
had died. Her father was a traveling salesman throughout his life and was able
to be with the family infrequently; he sold furniture in 1910 and stock in 1920.
Her sister, Domina Eberle, was born in September 1920 and also earned a PhD
in mathematics. Domina Spencer received her doctorate from MIT in 1942 under
the direction of Dirk J. Struik and has spent the major part of her career on
the faculty at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. She is one of the thirty-six
women interviewed by Margaret A. M. Murray for her book Women Becoming
Mathematicians: Creating a Professional Identity in Post-World War II America.
Vivian Spencer was taught at home, mainly by her mother, before enrolling in
Oberlin College in 1924. At that time the family moved to Oberlin, Ohio, where
they remained for most of the next decade. At Oberlin Vivian Spencer majored in
mathematics and English and received a bachelor’s degree in 1928. She remained
at Oberlin and received a master’s degree in mathematics the following year. From
1929 until 1933 she was a graduate assistant in mathematics at the University of
Pittsburgh during the academic year and studied at the University of Chicago dur-
ing several of the summers. In fall 1933 Vivian Spencer entered the graduate school
at the University of Pennsylvania. Her family joined her in Philadelphia, where her
thirteen-year-old sister, Domina, had her ﬁrst formal schooling and continued to re-
ceive mathematical instruction from Vivian. During 1933–34 Vivian Spencer was a
Bennett fellow at the University of Pennsylvania and took courses from F. W. Beal,
Arnold Dresden (of Swarthmore College), J. R. Kline, J. A. Shohat, and Anna Pell
Wheeler (of Bryn Mawr College). The following year she held a Moore fellowship,
took courses from Shohat and Hans Rademacher, and was admitted to candidacy
for the PhD in February 1935. During the fall of 1935 she was a research assistant,
in May 1936 she passed her PhD examination, and in June 1936 she received her
PhD.

Although Spencer no longer had a position at the University of Pennsylvania
after the ﬁrst semester 1935, she remained in Philadelphia and in January 1936
became a statistical research assistant for the National Research Project (NRP)
of the Works Progress Administration (WPA); she also worked as an associate
statistician for the US Bureau of Mines. She did research on fuel eﬃciency and
labor production, and, in addition to authoring NRP reports, she contributed to
the NRP volumes Production, Employment, and Productivity in 59 Manufacturing
Industries and Technology, Employment, and Productivity in Petroleum and Nat-
ural Gas Production. During 1936–37, while employed by the WPA, she audited a
graduate course in advanced economic statistics at the University of Pennsylvania.
In January 1940 Spencer moved to Washington, D.C., where she became a min-
eral economist and statistician for the US Department of Commerce. She worked for
the US Bureau of the Census within the Department of Commerce, ﬁrst as senior
professional assistant for the mines and quarries division of the census bureau. She

then held various positions such as statistician, senior statistician, senior economic
analyst, and assistant to the chief of the minerals section before becoming chief of
the minerals section in July 1948. From 1950 to 1952 she directed the statistical
staﬀ for the President’s Materials Policy Commission and in 1964 became special
assistant for raw materials and production indexes.

In 1969 Spencer moved from the Bureau of the Census to the US Department
of the Interior’s Bureau of Mines to become chief of the commodity staﬀ. She re-
mained in this position until her retirement in 1971. From 1957 to 1965 Spencer
was a professorial lecturer in statistics at American University and from 1973 was
an adjunct professor in the mathematics department of the University of Connecti-
cut, where her sister taught. Through the 1970s she continued to be listed as a
statistician at the Bureau of Mines in the Combined Membership List of the AMS,
MAA, and SIAM. She also served as a consultant to the census bureau in 1972 and
1977–78.

In the mid-1930s Vivian Spencer reported to the University of Pennsylvania
placement oﬃce that she played violin and piano and that she read English, Latin,
German, French, and Italian. In 1933 she listed her religious preference as Presby-
terian.

After her retirement from the government Spencer maintained her home in Wash-
ington, D.C. She also had a home in Boston, where her sister lived. She was seventy-
two years old when she died suddenly in 1980 in her Boston home from sepsis.
Services were held at St. Paul’s Church (Episcopal) in Brookline. She was survived
by her sister, Domina Ebele Spencer, and was buried in New Castle, Pennsylvania.
