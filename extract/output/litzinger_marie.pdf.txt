LITZINGER, Marie. May 14, 1899–April 7, 1952.
Bryn Mawr College (BA 1920, MA 1922), University of Chicago (PhD 1934).

Marie Paula Litzinger was born in Bedford, Pennsylvania, the eldest of ﬁve
children of Katherine (O’Connell) (1870–1948) and Rush C. Litzinger (1865–1927),
both natives of Pennsylvania. Her father worked for the Pennsylvania Railroad
as clerk, bookkeeper, and accountant. When the railroad moved its oﬃces out of
Bedford, he resigned his position and opened an insurance and real estate oﬃce
there. The other children were Katherine (1902–1990), Margaret (b. ca. 1905), Rush
C. Jr. (ca. 1906–1910), and Anna E. (b. ca. 1909).

Marie Litzinger attended elementary and secondary school in Bedford and grad-
uated from high school in 1916. She then attended Bryn Mawr College 1916–23,
where she received both her bachelor’s and master’s degrees. While there she held
several scholarships; she was the James E. Rhoads sophomore scholar 1917–18, the
ﬁrst Charles S. Hinchman memorial scholar 1918–19, and the Maria D. Eastman
Brooke Hall memorial scholar and Anna M. Powers memorial scholar 1919–20. In
1920 Marie Litzinger was awarded her BA in Latin and mathematics, magna cum
laude. She was awarded the Bryn Mawr European fellowship and the Shippen for-
eign scholarship 1920–21, but did not study abroad until 1923. She also taught in
the Devon Manor School in nearby Devon, Pennsylvania, during her two years as a
master’s student 1920–22. While at Bryn Mawr she studied with Olive C. Hazlett,
Anna Pell Wheeler, and Charlotte A. Scott.

Litzinger was awarded a mathematics resident fellowship of $810 for additional
graduate study at Bryn Mawr in 1922–23, the year after she received her master’s
degree. In addition to other work, she gave one talk each semester in the Mathemat-
ical Journal Club at Bryn Mawr. During the year 1923–24 she went to Europe and
attended courses by G. Castelnuovo, F. Enriques, and V. Volterra at the University
of Rome. The following year she taught at the Greenwich Academy in Greenwich,
Connecticut.

Litzinger began her association with Mount Holyoke College in 1925. She was in-
structor 1925–28 and assistant professor 1928–37. During this period Marie Litzinger’s
sister Anna was a student at Mount Holyoke. Anna Litzinger graduated in 1931
with an honors paper in chemistry and received a master’s degree in chemistry in
1933. Her sister Margaret attended Drexel Institute of Art, Science, and Industry
in Philadelphia in the late 1920s.

During the years 1928 through 1934 Marie Litzinger was in residence for four
quarters at the University of Chicago, one in autumn 1929 on a leave of absence from
Mount Holyoke. She wrote her PhD dissertation at Chicago under the direction of
L. E. Dickson and received her doctorate in 1934. Her dissertation was published
in the Transactions of the AMS the following year.

In 1937 Marie Litzinger was promoted to associate professor and was made chair-
man of the department at Mount Holyoke. She remained department chairman and
was promoted to professor in 1942. She held a chair in mathematics from the John
Stewart Kennedy Foundation after 1948. While at Mount Holyoke, Litzinger no-
tably strengthened the mathematics department. Among her college activities was
work on the academic committee, the space advisory committee, and the advisory
committee on appointments, reappointments, and promotions. She was also active
in the Connecticut Valley Colloquium, the Mount Holyoke chapter of the AAUP,

and the Connecticut Valley section of the Association of Teachers of Mathematics
in New England, where she served as secretary 1936–38, vice president 1939–40,
president elect 1940–41, and then president. In 1942 she and B. H. Brown of Dart-
mouth prepared the questions for the ﬁfth Putnam Competition. Litzinger joined
the AMS shortly after she went to Mount Holyoke and almost immediately started
attending meetings of the society. From 1934 through 1949, with the exception of
one year, she attended at least one, and usually several, meetings a year; most were
in New York City. Litzinger’s entry in Who Was Who in America (1951–1960)
indicates that she was a Democrat.

Litzinger traveled in France and Italy in the summer of 1951. She was forced
by illness to take a leave of absence from the college in November that year. At
that time she returned to Bedford, Pennsylvania, where her sister Katherine was
a high school teacher. Marie Litzinger died several months later at age ﬁfty-two.
Her three sisters survived her. In a tribute after her death, Alzada Comstock, an
economics colleague, recalled Litzinger’s delicate humor, imaginative outlook, time
for undergraduates, devotion to her family, and loyalty.
