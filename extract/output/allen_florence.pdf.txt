ALLEN, Florence E. October 4, 1876–December 31, 1960.
University of Wisconsin (BL 1900, ML 1901, PhD 1907).

Florence Eliza Allen was born in Horicon, Wisconsin, the second child and only
daughter of Eliza (North) (b. 1848), of Wisconsin, and Charles Allen (b. ca. 1836),
a native of New York. Her parents married in 1866. Her father was a lawyer, who,
it appears, died in 1890. In 1900, she, her mother, and her brother, Charles Elmer
Allen (1872–1954), were living in Madison, Wisconsin.

Florence Allen was a mathematics major as an undergraduate in the College
of Letters and Science at the University of Wisconsin. She was active in Castalia,
a literary society for women promoting interest in the ﬁne arts, and served as
secretary and president. She was on the executive board of the self government
association, was on the yearbook board, and was a member of Delta Delta Delta
social sorority. Florence Allen received her bachelor’s degree in 1900, a year after
her older brother, who had taught and worked as a court reporter before studying
at Wisconsin. They shared the same address, presumably with their mother, from
the fall of 1896 until 1902. Charles E. Allen received his PhD in botany in 1904
from the University of Wisconsin and was on the faculty there from 1901 to 1943,
when he retired as professor emeritus. He had attained the rank of professor in
1909. During his distinguished career he published extensively, was editor-in-chief
of The American Journal of Botany, was president of his professional associations,
received an honorary doctorate from the University of Chicago, and was elected to
the National Academy of Sciences.

Florence Allen stayed at Wisconsin as a resident graduate in mathematics and
philosophy 1900–01 and received her master’s degree in mathematics in 1901. She
was an assistant in mathematics at Wisconsin in 1901–02 and then became an
instructor of mathematics. She remained at that rank for forty-three years, even
though she had obtained her doctorate with a dissertation in geometry in 1907
and published her dissertation in 1914 and two additional research articles in 1915
and 1927. She became an assistant professor in the fall of 1945, shortly before
her sixty-ninth birthday. Her promotion came two years before she retired at the
rank of assistant professor emeritus. During her years at Wisconsin, in addition to
her regular teaching and committee responsibilities, she sometimes taught summer
courses, and she was active in planning and reporting on reunions for her class of
1900 in the Wisconsin alumni magazine.

As part of her entry in the 1914 Woman’s Who’s Who of America, Allen indi-
cated that she favored women’s suﬀrage. In response to an inquiry by Helen Owens
concerning the outlook for women doctorates in mathematics, Allen wrote on June
8, 1940:

Of course there will always be some women who should go in for a
Ph.D. – some because it will be an actual necessity to qualify them
for one of the occasional – very occasional – openings in college and
university positions, some because of the leisure they may have to
follow a congenial pursuit. But on the whole I see no great encour-
agement to be had from past experiences and observation. I do not
believe that there is or will be a great future for any but a few in
this ﬁeld. At present, it seems to me, as I look about this campus,
that in all strictly academic ﬁelds (not those special to women) that

there is a decided drop in the number of women engaged. That may
be peculiar to this economic phase, but I look for it to continue for
some time to come.

Florence E. Allen was a member of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts
and Letters and of the Congregational Church. She had lived at the same house on
Lathrop Street in Madison for more than ﬁfty years before her death at eighty-four
in a Madison, Wisconsin, hospital in 1960. She was survived by a niece and two
nephews and was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Horicon, Wisconsin.
