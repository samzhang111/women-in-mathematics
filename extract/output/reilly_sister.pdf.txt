REILLY, Sister Mary Henrietta. February 14, 1895–April 21, 1964.
St. Xavier College (BA 1923, MA 1925), Catholic University of America (PhD
1936).

Margaret Reilly was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Agnes (Finn) (b.
1869) and Michael Reilly (b. 1862), both born in Illinois of Irish parents. They
married in 1891. In 1900 the family lived in Chicago, and there were three children,
Agnes (b. 1893), Margaret (b. 1895), and Michael (b. 1898). Her father’s occupation
was listed as sewer builder.

Margaret Reilly received her high school diploma from Our Lady of Mercy Acad-
emy in Cincinnati in June 1914 and entered the congregation of the Religious Sisters
of Mercy in Cincinnati that same month. She took the religious name Mary Hen-
rietta and was known as Sister Henrietta. She took her perpetual vows in August
1917.

Except for her years as a doctoral student at Catholic University in Washington,
D.C., all but one of Sister Mary Henrietta’s assignments were in Cincinnati. She
ﬁrst taught in primary and secondary schools in Cincinnati while obtaining her
bachelor’s and master’s degrees and her state high school life teacher’s certiﬁcate.
She then taught in a teachers’ college in Cincinnati and studied for her doctorate
in Washington. Finally, she spent the last decade of her life teaching in secondary
schools in Piqua, Ohio, and in Cincinnati.

Sister Henrietta taught second grade at St. Edward School 1914–16; grades ﬁve
and six at St. Andrew School 1917–19; grades nine and ten, and music at Our
Lady of Mercy Academy 1919–22; grade nine and English at Elder High School
1922–25; and grades seven through ten and twelve at Mother of Mercy Academy
1925–28. During this period she obtained her bachelor’s degree in 1923 from St.
Xavier College (Xavier University since 1930), a Jesuit college for men, by attending
special classes scheduled in late afternoons, Saturdays, and summers for the sisters
from local and neighboring congregations. She obtained her state high school life
certiﬁcate in December 1923 having also earned credits from what was called in
congregation records Our Lady of Mercy Normal. She received a master’s degree
from St. Xavier College in August 1925 with a major in sociology and a minor in
philosophy.

In the period 1928–36 Sister Henrietta taught mathematics and science, and
she continued her studies. She taught at Teachers’ College of the Athenaeum of
Ohio 1928–31 and apparently earned some credits there as well. She then studied
at Catholic University, where she was in residence 1931–32. She taught again at
Teachers’ College 1933–34 before returning to Catholic University where she was
again in residence 1934–36. She wrote her dissertation in algebraic geometry and
received her PhD in 1936.

Sister Henrietta then returned to Cincinnati to resume her college teaching of
mathematics in the Athenaeum of Ohio. The Athenaeum had been formed by the
archbishop of Cincinnati in 1928 as a collection of four institutions: Mount St.
Mary’s of the West and St. Gregory seminaries, Teachers’ College, and the Insti-
tutum Divi Thomae, a graduate school of scientiﬁc research. Sister Henrietta was
head of the department at Teachers’ College at least from 1939 until 1949 and
remained there until 1953, when the Teachers’ College was discontinued and the
Institutum relocated.
