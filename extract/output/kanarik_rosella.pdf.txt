KANARIK, Rosella (Kanarik). February 7, 1909–.
University of Pittsburgh (BA 1930, MA 1931, PhD 1934).

Rosella Kanarik was born in Bartfa, Hungary, the elder of two children of Sarah
(Schondorf) (1886–1961) and Albert Kanarik (1874–1960), both of Bartfa. Her
mother had an elementary school education and was a housewife; her father had
some high school and was in business. At one point he was in the clothing business
and later, in 1930, was proprietor of a restaurant. He had immigrated to the United
States early in the twentieth century and then apparently returned to Hungary,
where her parents were married in November 1907. Her father returned to the US
in July 1912, and she and her mother arrived in September 1913. Her younger
brother, Edgar, born in Pittsburgh in 1926, later earned a bachelor’s degree from
the University of California at Los Angeles and became a high school teacher,
realtor, and investor.

Kanarik wrote that when she was taking her ﬁrst course in algebra in the ninth
grade, she “fell in love with mathematics.” Her teacher, Kenneth Clark, “made the
subject matter absorbing and challenging, especially word problems–the harder the
better. From then on [she] was a mathematics major” (Smithsonian questionnaire
1985). She attended public high schools, ﬁrst Wadleigh High School in New York
City 1923–25 and then the Fifth Avenue High School in Pittsburgh, from which
she graduated with highest honor in 1926.

Kanarik attended the University of Pittsburgh, where she has written that she
“was most fortunate to have Dr. Montgomery Culver as [her] calculus professor.
Not only did he make mathematics fascinating, he also took personal interest in his
students.” She wrote, “He inspired me and motivated me to go on to do graduate
work” (Smithsonian questionnaire 1985). She received her BA degree as a student
in the School of Education with high honor in 1930. She had a graduate scholar-
ship at Pittsburgh 1930–34, was an assistant in mathematics 1931–33, and taught
at Schenley Evening High School at least from 1931 until 1934. She received her
master’s degree in 1931 and her PhD with distinction in 1934. Culver, who had
received his own doctorate from Pittsburgh in 1927, directed her dissertation.

Kanarik wrote in 1985, “I graduated during the depression. It was almost im-
possible for anyone, let alone a woman, to ﬁnd a position in industry, college, or
university. I was lucky to get into a high school to teach mathematics.” It appears
that she taught some at the university, although not in a regular position, and in a
high school in Pittsburgh 1932–36.

On July 25, 1936, Rosella Kanarik and Emery Kanarik, her cousin, were married.
Emery Kanarik was born in 1909 in Bardejov Spa, Czechoslovakia, attended the
College of the City of New York 1926–28, and earned a Bachelor of Architecture
degree in 1932 after studying at the Columbia University School of Architecture.
Later he was president of the architectural ﬁrm Emery Kanarik and Associates,
organized in 1952 in California.

The Kanariks had two children, Richard, born in 1937, and Susan Carol, born in
1940, both in Los Angeles. Rosella Kanarik taught in high schools in Los Angeles
1939–46. “In 1946 when there was a great need for mathematics instructors, I was
hired as a lecturer at the University of Southern California,” she wrote in 1985. She
remained in that position until 1952 and while there taught courses at all levels,

from college algebra through a graduate course in analysis. She also taught at a high
school in Los Angeles 1951–53, and in 1953 was hired as the ﬁrst woman member
of the mathematics department at Los Angeles City College. She spent the rest
of her career there, as instructor 1953–61, associate professor 1961–67, professor
1967–74, and professor emeritus after 1974. She also served as counselor 1956–62.
She remarked that she would never have retired if it had not been mandatory when
she became sixty-ﬁve.

Since her retirement Kanarik has been a member of various retired teacher or-
ganizations and has done volunteer work tutoring high school and college students
in mathematics. She wrote that it is a labor of love, for she loved teaching at any
level. She has also been a member of the UCLA Aﬃliates, the Los Angeles Women’s
Architectural League, the Brandeis University National Women’s Committee, and
Pioneer Women. Kanarik is Jewish and a Democrat and has enjoyed traveling, the-
atre, reading, playing bridge, and cooking. Emery Kanarik died in 1992, and Rosella
Kanarik has continued to live in Los Angeles and to maintain her membership in
the MAA. The Los Angeles City College awards the Rosella Kanarik scholarship
each spring to a qualifying mathematics student. “This merit-based scholarship
was created by a generous donation from Dr. Rosella Kanarik” (Los Angeles City
College Foundation, Rosella Kanarik Scholarship).
