TURNER, Bird M. April 18, 1877–September 5, 1962.
West Virginia University (BA 1915, MA 1917), Bryn Mawr College (PhD 1920).

Bird Margaret Turner was the second child and ﬁrst of four daughters of Mary Jane
(Douglas) (1847–1917) and John Marion Turner (1838–1910). Her parents were natives of
Virginia (West Virginia after statehood in 1863) and married in 1873. Her father was a
farmer in the Moundsville area in the northwest panhandle of West Virginia from before
her birth in Moundsville until his retirement. Her brother, Will D., was two years older
than she, and her three sisters were Lulu (1879–1953), Carrie (b. 1881), and Dess (1887–
1949).

Bird Turner graduated from the Moundsville high school in 1893 and taught in the
Moundsville area for most of the next two decades. She taught at Wood Hill school, a
county grade school, 1895–96, and in Moundsville 1896–1900, where she taught fourth,
seventh, and eighth grades. She taught mathematics in the Moundsville high school 1900–
1913. Starting in 1900 she took summer courses toward her undergraduate degree: at
West Virginia University in 1900, at Harvard University in 1907, at Bethany College in
West Virginia in 1909 (spring and summer), and again at West Virginia University in the
summers 1910, 1912–14. She was a student assistant at West Virginia University 1913–15
and received her BA there in 1915, at age thirty-eight, with majors in mathematics and
physics. She was a member of the social sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma and the English
club and won the Chi Omega prize in economics. Turner was an instructor in the summer
school at West Virginia University in 1915, returned to Moundsville as principal of the
high school for the year 1915–16, and was instructor in the summer school at West Virginia
again in the summer of 1916.

Turner began her graduate work as a scholar in mathematics at Bryn Mawr College
in the academic year 1916–17. During that ﬁrst year she took a “seminary” in diﬀerential
geometry, one in formal algebra, one in education, and the journal club in mathematics.
She was granted the (honorary) President M. Carey Thomas European fellowship for her
ﬁrst year’s work. She received her master’s degree from West Virginia University in 1917
and was assistant director of the Phebe Anna Thorne Model School of Bryn Mawr College
1917–18; she lists the Model School as her aﬃliation for the January 1920 MAA meeting
in New York City. Turner was a reader in mathematics at Bryn Mawr College during
1918–19, and, as a resident fellow during 1919–20, she ﬁnished her dissertation under
the direction of Charlotte A. Scott. While at Bryn Mawr, she had studied under Scott,
Olive C. Hazlett, Anna Johnson Pell (Wheeler), and Matilde Castro. Turner was Scott’s
sixth, and next-to-last, PhD student and was forty-three when she received her doctorate.
Between the ages of forty-ﬁve and ﬁfty-two she published three articles in the American
Journal of Mathematics and two in the Annals of Mathematics.

Turner was an instructor at the University of Illinois for three years after she received
her PhD in 1920. In 1923 she returned to West Virginia University, and in November
of the following year she gave a talk at the organizational meeting of the West Virginia
Academy of Science. She was assistant professor 1923–25, associate professor 1925–31, and
professor 1931–47. In 1947, at age seventy, she retired as professor emeritus. A colleague
at West Virginia University was Margaret Buchanan Cole, who had also received a BA
from West Virginia and who overlapped with Turner in her studies at Bryn Mawr before
receiving her PhD in 1922.

Four years after her retirement, Turner returned to Moundsville, where she was a
member of the Moundsville Presbyterian Church and the Moundsville Women’s Club. She
was a Republican. Bird Turner died in her home in Moundsville, West Virginia, at age
eighty-ﬁve in 1962. She was survived by nieces and nephews and was buried in Mt. Rose
Cemetery in Moundsville.

Organizational aﬃliations: AMS, MAA (charter member), AAAS, Phi Beta Kappa.
