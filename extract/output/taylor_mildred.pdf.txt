TAYLOR, Mildred E. July 25, 1898–November 3, 1978.
Oxford College for Women (BA 1921), University of Illinois (MA 1922, PhD
1931).

Mildred Ellen Taylor, born in Virginia, Illinois, was the eldest of eight children of Emily
Elizabeth (Treadway) (b. 1874) and Angus Taylor (b. 1872), natives of Illinois. Her parents
married in 1897, and her father was a farmer in the central part of the state. The other
children in the family were William Marion (1900–1997), Miriam (1902–1989), Kenneth
Archibald (1904–1996), Angus Donald (1907–1982), Emily Christine (1909–1995), Vivian
(1914–2003), and Miza (1916–1989).

Mildred Taylor graduated from the high school in Virginia, Illinois, in 1917 and entered
Oxford College for Women in Ohio that fall. In 1918–19 and 1920–21 she was a special
student at Miami University doing course work in physics. While at Oxford College, which
merged with Miami University in 1928, she was involved in many activities including the
athletic association and YWCA all four years. After her graduation in 1921, she received a
scholarship from the University of Illinois for the year 1921–22. She received her master’s
degree in 1922 and taught the next year in the Johnston City Township high school in
southern Illinois.

From 1923 until 1929 Taylor taught as an instructor at Knox College in Galesburg,
Illinois. During this time she was working toward her PhD at the University of Illinois
and regularly attended meetings of the Illinois Section of the MAA. She took a leave of
absence from Knox 1929–30 to spend her only full year in residence at the University of
Illinois. All of her other course work occurred during the summers 1924 to 1926 and 1927
to 1930. She received her doctorate in 1931 with a dissertation in algebraic geometry and
with a minor in physics.

In 1930 Taylor was hired as professor of mathematics and department head at Mary
Baldwin College in Staunton, Virginia. This college for women, originally chartered in
1845, became ﬁrst a seminary, then a junior college, and in 1923 a four-year college. When
Taylor arrived in 1930 there were approximately 250 students. In 1937 her title changed
to professor of mathematics and astronomy. She remained at Mary Baldwin until her
retirement in 1968. Throughout her career at Mary Baldwin, Taylor attended national
meetings of the AMS and the MAA and meetings of the Maryland-District of Columbia-
Virginia Section of the MAA. In 1938 she was elected to the executive committee of the
section, and in 1953 she was elected its vice chair.

Taylor was also active in Pi Mu Epsilon, Sigma Delta Epsilon, and the AAUW. She
was chair of the national alumnae committee of Sigma Delta Epsilon 1942–43 and was
secretary of the Virginia branch of the AAUW in 1940–41. She attended a number of
annual meetings of the NCTM in the 1950s; she was chairman of the ushers and secretaries
committee in Chicago in 1950, and she gave talks about teaching geometry at the college
level in Atlantic City and Cincinnati in 1953 and 1954. She indicated in about 1940 that
she was a Presbyterian and a Republican.

Mildred Taylor was living in Staunton, Virginia, at the time of her death at age eighty
in 1978. She was survived by her three brothers and four sisters. The funeral service was
held at the First Presbyterian Church in Staunton, and she was buried in East Lawn
Memorial Park in Urbana, Illinois.

Organizational aﬃliations: AMS, MAA, NCTM, AAAS, Sigma Delta Epsilon, AAUW,
Pi Mu Epsilon.
