DICKERMAN, Elizabeth Street. November 13, 1872–April 24, 1965.
Smith College (BA 1894), Yale University (PhD 1896).

Elizabeth Street Dickerman was born in West Haven, Connecticut, the daugh-
ter of Elizabeth Mansﬁeld (Street) (1843–1926), born in New York, and George
Sherwood Dickerman (1843–1937), of Connecticut. Her maternal grandfather was
a minister who had graduated from Yale, and her father was a Congregational min-
ister who earned a BA from Yale in 1865 and a BD from the Yale Divinity School
in 1868. Her parents married in 1870 and had four children: Elizabeth Street; Sher-
wood Owen (1874–1930) and Amy Eliot (1879–1980), both born in Maine; and
Alfred Deluce (1885–1920), born in Massachusetts. Her brother Sherwood received
a BA from Yale in 1896, a PhD from Halle in 1909, and was a professor of Greek
at Williams College. Her sister graduated from Smith College in 1900, attended
the Yale School of Music the following year, and later married. Her brother Alfred
attended Washington and Lee University.

Elizabeth Street Dickerman graduated from high school in Amherst, Massachusetts,

in 1890 before entering nearby Smith College, where her chief subjects of under-
graduate study were mathematics, philosophy, social science, French, German, and
music before her graduation in 1894. She entered Yale University that autumn and
studied with Hubert A. Newton, J. Willard Gibbs, Andrew W. Phillips, Irving
Fisher, and James Pierpont. She held a scholarship there her second year and re-
ceived her PhD in 1896 with no advisor designated. The following year, 1896–97,
she took a course on linear diﬀerential equations with Pierpont, and in 1899–1900
she attended a course on thermodynamics and properties of matter given by Gibbs.
In the decade after receiving her PhD, Dickerman was primarily occupied with
private teaching. She also traveled in Europe for four months in 1897 and again
in 1902 and was ﬂuent in French, German, and Italian. The next several years
she had formal teaching positions. She taught mathematics at Greenwich Academy
1904–05; substituted as professor of mathematics at the College for Women of West-
ern Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, 1906–07; and taught mathematics and
psychology at Ingleside School in New Milford, Connecticut, 1907–13. In 1910 she
registered with the Smith College faculty committee on recommendations seeking
an appointment either in college teaching or administrative work. At this time she
was a member of the New England Association of Teachers of Mathematics.

After 1914 Dickerman was mainly engaged in literary work and some private
teaching while living in New Haven. During World War I, she selected and translated
war poems for a calendar, Songs of our Allies, the proceeds of which were to go to
wounded French soldiers. She served as assistant to the editor of the Yale Review
in 1917. Her literary work includes translations of poetry from the French, books
of poetical reminiscences of her travels, and various other articles. She made a trip
to Bermuda in 1921 and followed that with a book of verse about the trip. In 1924
she conducted a Round Table on Industrial Relations in New Haven in connection
with the AAUW.

Dickerman reported in 1936 that she was devoting time to the care of her father
who was seriously ill. Her primary residence before his death in 1937 was her family
home in New Haven; after his death she moved to an apartment there. From the
mid-1920s, she also maintained a summer home on Squirrel Island, Maine, where
her maternal grandparents had also had a home. In 1938, at sixty-ﬁve, she made a

trip to France. During her last few years, she lived most of the time at the home of
her sister, Amy Humstone, in Greenwich, returning to her apartment in New Haven
for a few weeks each spring and fall.

Elizabeth Dickerman died in Greenwich, Connecticut, in 1965 after a month in
the hospital following surgery for a broken hip. She was ninety-two. After services at
the United Church on the Green in New Haven, interment followed in the Centerville
Cemetery in Hamden, Connecticut.
