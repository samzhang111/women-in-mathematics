WHELAN, A. Marie. September 6, 1895–June 14, 1966.
Goucher College (BA 1918), Johns Hopkins University (PhD 1923).

Anna Marie Whelan was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the sixth of eight children of
Honora A. (Conroy) (b. 1865) and James J. Whelan (b. 1862). Her parents had each
emigrated from Ireland as children in about 1875 and had married eight or nine years
later. In 1900, according to the census report, the family included seven children: James
E. (b. 1885); Catherine M. (b. 1886); Elenora [Eleanora] (b. 1888); Jim Joseph [James
J.] (b. 1890); John Joseph (b. 1892); Anna M., (b. 1894 [sic]); and Loretta E. (b. 1897).
The father’s occupation was listed as clerk. In 1920 it was reported that six children were
living at home in Baltimore, including the eighth child, Laura E., age nineteen. That year
the father’s occupation was listed as salesman at a clothiers.

After Marie Whelan graduated from Western High School in Baltimore in 1914, she
entered Goucher College and graduated four years later. She began her graduate studies at
the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in the fall of 1918. Except for the year 1920–21
when she taught in Pullman, West Virginia, she attended Johns Hopkins continuously
until she received her doctorate in 1923. She attended the summer school in 1919 and
held a university fellowship in mathematics 1919–20. A Johns Hopkins directory indicates
that she also taught in the summer sessions of 1919 and 1920. While her dissertation was
written under the direction of Frank Morley, in her dissertation vita she also acknowledged
the “valuable suggestions” received from A. B. Coble, an earlier PhD student of Morley
and former Johns Hopkins faculty member, who was then on the faculty at the University
of Illinois. Her subordinate subjects at Johns Hopkins were applied mathematics and
geophysics.

After receiving her PhD in 1923, Marie Whelan, who sometimes used the name A.
Marie Whelan professionally, taught for two years each at Olivet College in Michigan and
Dominican College of San Rafael in California. She joined the faculty at Hunter College as
instructor in 1927 and was an assistant professor from 1932 until her retirement in 1965.
During her ﬁrst decade there she often was associated with the evening and extension
sessions.

In addition to the two plays she published in the Mathematics Clubs section of the
Monthly, 1930 and 1938, Whelan also wrote a two-act play, “Grabitall,” that was pre-
sented by the mathematics club at Hunter College in the spring of 1937. The play dealt
with the mathematics of the Townsend Plan, a proposal to end the Great Depression by
instituting a pension plan for all retirees over the age of sixty.

Anna Marie Whelan died in 1966 in the Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan after a
short illness. She was seventy. After her death, a high requiem mass was celebrated at the
Immaculate Heart of Mary Church and she was buried in New Cathedral Cemetery in
Baltimore. She was survived by her sister Loretta E. Whelan with whom she had lived in
New York, a sister-in-law, and a niece and nephew.
