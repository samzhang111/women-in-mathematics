HUMPHREYS, M. Gweneth. October 22, 1911–October 6, 2006.
University of British Columbia (BA 1932), Smith College (MA 1933), Univer-
sity of Chicago (PhD 1935).

Mabel Gweneth Humphreys was born in South Vancouver, British Columbia, the
only child of Mabel Jane (Thomas) (1885–1963) and Richard Humphreys (1880–
1969). Her mother was born in London, England, and was a dressmaker, ﬂorist, and
housewife. Her father was born in Pwllheli in Northwest Wales and was a machin-
ist. They were married in 1910. Her secondary education was in North Vancouver,
British Columbia. She attended North Vancouver High School 1925–28, the Uni-
versity of British Columbia 1928–32, Smith College 1932–33, and the University of
Chicago 1933–35.

Humphreys held scholarships all four years she was an undergraduate at the
University of British Columbia before graduating with honors in mathematics and
earning the Governor General’s Gold Medal in 1932. In 1981 she described how
she came to study and live in the United States. “When I graduated in ’32 the
appropriation for the university had been cut so much that they stopped giving
graduate work in mathematics that year. I was supposed to have an assistantship
but it ‘melted away.’ So, [Professor F. S. Nolan] helped me apply for scholarships,
fellowships in the United States and in Canada. And I received one at Smith College,
a fellowship, and went there for my master’s degree” (Smithsonian meeting tapes).
At Smith she studied with Professors Neal McCoy, Susan Rambo, and Ruth G.
Wood before receiving her master’s degree in 1933. She also reported that Nolan and
another of the mathematics professors at the University of British Columbia had
gotten their doctorates at the University of Chicago. Therefore, after receiving her
master’s degree, Humphreys applied to Chicago where she was awarded a fellowship
that she held for the next two years. She earned her PhD in 1935, having written
her dissertation in number theory as a student of L. E. Dickson. Each year that she
was at Chicago, she gave a talk at the department’s Junior Mathematics Club.

After receiving her PhD, Humphreys remained in the United States and became
a naturalized citizen in 1941. In 1981 she recalled her ﬁrst attempts to ﬁnd a job.

I had hoped that the University of Chicago would hear about a job
for me, but only one came through, and the male candidate who
got his thesis at the same time got that job. In the meantime, I had
registered at a teacher’s agency in downtown Chicago, and many
cards came in for the sum of something like $900, and you taught all
the mathematics in the four years, and you were dean of women, or
all of mathematics and coach some sport. I said to myself I wasn’t
going to do this; I was going to stick around in Chicago and wait
tables somewhere and study more mathematics. After awhile a card
came through from Kansas, a woman’s college, and they needed a
woman with a PhD in either mathematics or physics to teach both.
This was a substitute position, which was vacant because Sr. Helen
Sullivan . . . was ill. I took that and taught there for that one year.
I was very busy I must say, but it was a great apprenticeship. I
enjoyed it very much. (Smithsonian meeting tapes)

Thus, her ﬁrst position was instructor of mathematics and physics, 1935–36, at
Mt. St. Scholastica College in Atchison, Kansas. Emma Olson was acting head of

the department the previous year and Sister M. Helen Sullivan became head in
1935. In 1936 Humphreys became an instructor at H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial
College in New Orleans, Louisiana, where Nola Anderson (Haynes) was department
chairman. In 1941, with Marie Weiss as chairman, Humphreys was promoted to
assistant professor. In the summers of 1944 and 1946, she was assistant professor
at Barnard College and Tulane University, respectively.

In 1949 Humphreys left Newcomb to become associate professor at Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College (now Randolph College) in Lynchburg, Virginia, where
she was to remain for the rest of her career. That same year Gillie Larew, who had
been chairman since 1936, became dean of the college. At the end of Humphreys’
ﬁrst year at Randolph-Macon she was named Larew Professor and head of the
department. She remained as head until 1979. In 1973 she was also named Dana
Professor; she retired in 1980 as the Gillie A. Larew and Charles A. Dana Professor
Emeritus. During her tenure at Randolph-Macon, she was on sabbatical leave and
holder of a faculty fellowship from the Fund for the Advancement of Education in
the academic year 1955–56, during which she studied at the University of British
Columbia and examined undergraduate programs at several colleges and universities
during short visits. She was a National Science Foundation faculty fellow 1962–63
while on sabbatical as a visiting professor at the University of British Columbia.

For most summers from 1959 to 1970 Humphreys taught in NSF summer in-
stitutes for high school teachers held at Randolph-Macon. From 1965 to 1969 she
worked for the Educational Testing Service; she was on a committee to construct
a new institutional mathematics test 1965–67 and served as a consultant for the
mathematics undergraduate record examination 1967–69. In 1975 she was a con-
sultant for the American Council on Education on credit for mathematics courses
given by nonacademic organizations.

Humphreys was active in the MAA at both the sectional and national levels.
She was vice-chairman of the Maryland-District of Columbia-Virginia Section of
the MAA 1952–53 and 1957–58. At the national level, she served on the Commit-
tee on Mathematical Personnel and Education in the mid-1950s, on the Board of
Governors 1962–65 as Governor of her section, and on the Committee on the Un-
dergraduate Program in Mathematics (CUPM) 1965–67. She was on the CUPM ad
hoc committee to prepare a report identifying qualiﬁcations for a college teacher
of mathematics; the committee prepared a report published by CUPM in 1967.
Humphreys was also on the CUPM Panel on Mathematics in Two-Year Colleges
1966–67 and on the Joint Interim Central Coordinating Committee on Films and
Television in the early 1960s. She was an MAA consultant and visiting lecturer
1973–75.

From the 1950s through the 1970s Humphreys gave many presentations across
Virginia and the rest of the country. In the 1960s she often spoke at conferences
about the CUPM recommendations for the mathematics curriculum, while in the
1970s she spoke at schools about mathematics in music and art. She produced two
sets of lecture notes. One, “Linear algebra and analysis,” was joint with H. F. Davis
and comprised notes for a course given at the University of British Columbia in
1956–57; another, “Linear algebra and geometry,” appeared in many versions, the
latest in 1974.

Humphreys served as vice president of the local chapter of AAUP 1959 and 1974–
75 and as president 1959–60 and 1973–74. She was treasurer of the local chapter

of Sigma Xi 1960–61 and 1966–68, secretary 1968–70, vice president 1970–72, and
president 1972–74.

In 1981 Humphreys listed her hobbies as gardening and reading. She was active
in the Natural Bridge Appalachian Trail Club and served as a member of the
council in 1954, 1955, 1970, and 1971. She continued to live in Lynchburg after
her retirement in 1980 and died at home in 2006, shortly before her ninety-ﬁfth
birthday. Her obituary indicates that she was “survived by her friends and other
retirees from Randolph Macon Woman’s College.” Her estate included a bequest of
$24,000 to the MAA.

At Humphreys’ memorial service a tribute by her former student Carol Wood
was read. Wood noted that “the words ‘supportive’ and ‘empowering’ were not
current in the 60s but they apply to Gwen’s demeanor towards her students, however
undeserving and naive we were. Several of us have gone on to careers involving
substantial mathematics, and owe a debt to her” (Benkart 2010, 14). Wood, a former
president of the Association for Women in Mathematics, later proposed that AWM
establish a mentoring award in Humphrey’s honor, and this was done in 2010. The
M. Gweneth Humphreys Award was funded by former students and colleagues from
Randolph-Macon to “recognize an undergraduate mathematics teacher . . . who
has had a signiﬁcant impact on one or more female students through mentoring”
(Benkart 2010, 13).
