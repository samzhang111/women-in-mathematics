LANDERS, Mary (Kenny). February 5, 1905–November 18, 1990.
Brown University (Women’s College) (BA 1926), Brown University (MA 1927),
University of Chicago (PhD 1939).

Mary Virginia Kenny was born in Fall River, Massachusetts, the eldest of six chil-
dren of Katherine (Connell) (1876–1958) and Bernard Francis Kenny (1878–1963).
Her mother was a native of Massachusetts, and her father was born in England
before immigrating to the United States in 1893. Both were of Irish ancestry. In the
1920 and 1930 US census her father’s occupation was listed as letter carrier, civil
service. The other children in the family were Margaret, Dorothy, Mildred, Rita,
and Bernard Jr., the youngest. They ranged in age from about a year younger than
Mary to about a dozen years younger.

Kenny attended public schools in Fall River before entering Women’s College
in Brown University in September 1922. Yearbook entries indicate that she played
violin and was a skilled debater. After receiving her bachelor’s degree in 1926, she
stayed at Brown as an Anne Crosby Emery fellow in the mathematics department
and received her master’s degree in June 1927. Kenny was an instructor on a tem-
porary assignment in the mathematics department at Hunter College 1927–28 and
during that year became a member of the American Mathematical Society as a
nominee of the publishing company Allyn and Bacon. The temporary nature of her
appointment was dropped in 1928. She continued her graduate work in mathematics
by taking one class at Columbia University each semester during the years 1928–30
while teaching at Hunter. Beginning in spring 1930, and continuing through spring
1932, Kenny taught in the evening and extension sessions at Hunter.

A fellow student and an assistant in the department at Brown during 1926–27
was Aubrey Wilfred Landers Jr. He was born in New Hampshire on September 2,
1906, and received a BA from Acadia University in Nova Scotia in 1926. Landers
continued as assistant at Brown until 1929, when he received his MS in mathematics.
That spring R. G. D. Richardson at Brown wrote several letters of recommendation
for Landers to institutions in New York City, noting that Landers had personal
reasons for wanting to be in the city. In 1929–30, Landers continued his graduate
work by taking a class (six semester hours) at Columbia University while teaching
as an instructor at Hunter College. That summer Kenny and Landers returned to
Providence to attend the ﬁrst of many meetings of the American Mathematical
Society. That fall Landers moved to Brooklyn College as instructor, but in spring
1931 he joined Kenny teaching in the evening and extension sessions at Hunter. On
July 30, 1932, Mary Kenny and Landers were married, after which they continued
their positions at Hunter and Brooklyn College, respectively.

In the summer of 1933, Mary and Aubrey Landers resumed their graduate work,
this time at the University of Chicago. They were in residence 1933–34 and all
summers 1933–39 except for 1936. They worked in the calculus of variations, and
the dissertations of both were supervised jointly by G. A. Bliss and his former PhD
student at Chicago, M. R. Hestenes. Mary K. Landers and Aubrey W. Landers
received their doctorates in December 1939. They and Ellen Clayton Stokes were
the last of the ﬁfty-three PhD students of Bliss.

Mary Landers continued at Hunter College as instructor 1928–47, assistant pro-
fessor 1947–58, associate professor 1958–63, professor 1964–75, and professor emer-
itus after 1975. In 1941 she and Marguerite D. Darkow, then an assistant professor
at Hunter, produced a preliminary edition of a book, Elementary Mathematics.

Aubrey Landers was at Brooklyn College as instructor 1930–47, assistant profes-
sor 1947–52, associate professor 1952–67, professor 1967–74, and professor emeritus
after 1974. In 1967–68, he directed Brooklyn College’s Oﬃce of Grants and Re-
search.

During World War II, Aubrey Landers was on military leave from Brooklyn
College. As an oﬃcer in the US Naval Reserve, he was on active duty in Washington,
D.C., from 1942 to 1946, doing cryptographic work. Mary Landers, who remained
in New York, joined him in Washington in January 1944, two days before their
son, Robert, was (prematurely) born. On leave from Hunter College, Mary Landers
remained in Washington, and in September 1945 gave birth to a daughter, Patricia.
The war over, the family moved back to New York in May 1946. By adjusting their
teaching schedules and later hiring a housekeeper, they were able to resume full-time
teaching. Their third child, Richard, was born in New York in January 1949.

Both of the Landers were engaged in early eﬀorts to improve conditions for
members of the college teaching profession. From 1959 to 1972, Mary Landers was
secretary of the Legislative Conference, an organization that represented the pro-
fessional staﬀ of the public colleges in New York City and sought to inﬂuence
legislation aﬀecting the faculty and administrators. The conference merged with
the United Federation of College Teachers in 1972 to become the Professional Staﬀ
Congress and the bargaining agent for the professional staﬀ at City University of
New York (CUNY). Mary Landers served as co-secretary of the new organization
and as co-chairman of the Hunter College unit. In a November 20, 1964, article in
the New York Times on the City University budget, Mary Landers is quoted as
declaring that “too few promotions and too heavy a teaching load are two areas of
great dissatisfaction to many members of the faculties.” She also served as trustee
of the City University Welfare Board and as chairman of the Isabelle Scott Bollard
Scholarship Committee. Organizational aﬃliations in addition to those listed be-
low include the New York Academy of Sciences and the New York State Teachers
Association.

Aubrey Landers died on May 2, 1986. Mary Landers died in the Rhode Island
Hospital in Providence of colon cancer four and a half years later at the age of eighty-
ﬁve. She was survived by her three children, two sisters, and seven grandchildren.
Both Aubrey and Mary Landers are buried in Swan Point Cemetery in Providence.
Organizational aﬃliations: AMS, MAA, AAAS, Sigma Delta Epsilon, NEA, AAUW,
AAUP, Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi, Pi Mu Epsilon.
