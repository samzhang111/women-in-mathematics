TULLER, Annita. December 30, 1910–August 29, 1994.
Hunter College (BA 1929), Bryn Mawr College (MA 1930, PhD 1937).

Annita Tuller was the daughter of Ida (Bick) (1883–1931) and Morris Tuller (1886–
1934), natives of Russia who were likely Jewish. Her mother had attended religious school
and her father the equivalent of high school before they came to the United States in 1908.
Her parents married in November 1909, Annita was born a year later in Brooklyn, New
York, and a brother, Theodore, was born in 1916. Her mother was a housewife, her father
was a jeweler, and her brother later became a physician.

Annita Tuller received her primary and secondary education in the public schools of
Brooklyn. She graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in 1925 at age fourteen and en-
tered Hunter College that same year. In 1985 Tuller recalled from her Hunter experience
that Carolyn Eisele, her freshman mathematics teacher, “inspired me, as an undergrad-
uate, to change my major from French to Math,” and the “lectures [of Louis Weisner]
on Non-Euclidean Geometry focussed my interest in geometries” (Smithsonian question-
naire). In her dissertation vita, she thanked Lao G. Simons of Hunter “who suggested I
do graduate work in math.”

In the fall of 1929, after her graduation from Hunter, Tuller entered, as a graduate
scholar, Bryn Mawr College, where her ﬁrst graduate school instructor was Anna Pell
Wheeler, whom she described as “a role model for me, [who] inspired me to go on to
the Ph.D.” (Smithsonian questionnaire). After earning her master’s degree at the end
of the academic year 1929–30, she returned to Hunter, at age nineteen, as a substitute
instructor in mathematics for a year. From 1931 to 1935 she was a mathematics and
physics teacher at William Cullen Bryant High School in Long Island City, Queens, New
York. She returned to Bryn Mawr, as a resident fellow 1935–36 and as a graduate scholar
1936–37. She completed her work for the PhD with a dissertation in diﬀerential geometry
written under the direction of Gustav A. Hedlund, whom she later indicated, “encouraged
me all the way” (Smithsonian questionnaire).

Tuller became a tutor at Hunter College in the fall of 1937, just after she received
her Bryn Mawr PhD. She was in Europe in the summer of 1938. On November 23, 1938,
she married Morris Levine (1912–1983) of Brooklyn, who worked for, and later became
circulation manager for, a newspaper publishing ﬁrm in New York. The Levines had two
daughters, Judith, born in 1942, and Diane, born in 1944. Judith graduated from the
University of Southern California and did graduate work later. Diane graduated from
Swarthmore College and earned a PhD from Columbia University in 1973 in language and
modern literature.

Annita Tuller, who continued to use her maiden name professionally, remained on the
faculty at Hunter College: as tutor 1937–39, instructor 1939–49, assistant professor 1949–
61, and associate professor 1961–68. She was teaching at the Bronx campus of Hunter
when it became an independent college, Herbert H. Lehman College (CUNY), in 1968.
She then taught at Lehman as professor and retired as professor emeritus on February 1,
1971.

During her career at Hunter and at Lehman, Tuller taught a variety of undergradu-
ate courses as well as graduate courses in non-Euclidean geometry, modern geometries,
analytic projective geometry, and diﬀerential geometry. She taught in an NSF summer in-
stitute in 1959 and in an academic year institute in 1965–66. She gave a number of talks,
mainly in geometry; two were to the Veterans Math Club at the Fort Trumbull Division
of the University of Connecticut in 1949 and 1950. From 1958 to 1970, as a member of
the MAA Speaker’s Bureau, she spoke in high schools in the New York metropolitan area.
She was active in the Metropolitan New York Section of the History of Science Society,
for which she was chairman of the hospitality committee in the mid-1950s and was trea-
surer from 1959 for about a decade. She also was a member of the New York Academy

of Sciences. Tuller did several pre-publication reviews for publishers, reviewed a number
of books for Scripta Mathematica, worked for Collier’s Encyclopedia on a revision of a
bibliography in mathematics, and, most notably, wrote a widely used and admired text,
A Modern Introduction to Geometries, which appeared in 1967.

When her children were in elementary school, Tuller was active in the PTA. Later she
did community work as a member of the Briarwood Community Association and volunteer
work recording mathematics texts for the blind. She was a member of UNA-USA (United
Nations Association of the United States of America), the US Committee for UNICEF,
Common Cause, AARP, and was a registered Democrat.

Annita Tuller moved to a residence for senior citizens in Cupertino, California, after
suﬀering a serious heart attack in early 1993. She was living there at the time of her death
at age eighty-three in 1994.
