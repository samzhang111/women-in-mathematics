HAGEN, Beatrice L. July 4, 1899–July 22, 1987.
University of Kansas (BA 1920), University of Chicago (MA 1926, PhD 1930).

Beatrice Liberty Hagen was the youngest child of Lena (Sessler) (1865–1948),
originally from Illinois, and Louis Hagen, born in Wisconsin in 1857. She was born
in Barton County, near Ellinwood, in central Kansas, where her father was a farmer.
In the 1900 census it was reported that her parents had been married sixteen years
and that there were four children living of ﬁve born. They were Bertha (1884–1973),
Charles (1890–1951), Maude (1892–1974), and Beatrice. All were born in Kansas.
Beatrice Hagen received her elementary and secondary education in public schools
and graduated from Ellinwood High School in 1916. She then attended the Univer-
sity of Kansas, where Wealthy Babcock was one year ahead of her; Florence Black
was an instructor and graduate student during Hagen’s ﬁnal two years at Kansas.
After receiving her bachelor’s degree in 1920, she taught in Kansas high schools;
she was in Burlington 1920–22 and in Dodge City 1923–24.

In 1924 Hagen entered the University of Chicago, where she studied for the next
two years and received her master’s degree in 1926, having written a thesis with
E. P. Lane. She then taught at Ozark Wesleyan College in Carthage, Missouri, in
1926–27. Ozark Wesleyan had opened the previous year and closed in 1932. She also
taught at Nebraska State Normal College (now Chadron State College) in Chadron
1928–29. After further study at Chicago and completing a dissertation in projective
diﬀerential geometry directed by Lane, she received her PhD in 1930.

Hagen’s ﬁrst position after her degree was at Fort Hays Kansas State College
(now Fort Hays State University) 1930–31. In 1931 she took a position as instruc-
tor at Pennsylvania State College (now Pennsylvania State University), where she
remained until her retirement in 1959. She was promoted to assistant professor in
1940, to associate professor in 1945, and to professor in 1956, three years before
her retirement. Among her female colleagues at Penn State were Helen Brewster
Owens, Teresa Cohen, Aline Huke Frink, and Ethel Moody. It appears that in the
late 1940s Hagen gave a speech on women in astronomy to the local chapter of
Sigma Delta Epsilon (now Sigma Delta Epsilon-Graduate Women in Science) at
Penn State. The text of her talk appears in the Owens Papers.

Hagen was appointed a temporary associate professor at Kansas State University
in Manhattan after her retirement from Penn State and taught there 1960–62. In
1964 she moved to Great Bend, Kansas, where she made a home with her two
sisters, Bertha and Maude. Bertha had remained in the area, cared for her parents,
and helped with the family farm. Maude, who attended the University of Kansas,
was a French teacher in Hiawatha, Kansas; she moved to Great Bend after her
retirement. Both Beatrice and Maude did tutoring after retiring. Beatrice Hagen
was a member of the Sunshine Club in Ellinwood, about ten miles from Great Bend,
and was a Presbyterian. In 1940 she described herself as a Republican.

In a February 14, 1978, letter to one of the authors, Beatrice Hagen reported
that “women were quite frankly advised not to enter the higher ﬁelds of mathe-
matics, physics and chemistry because there was diﬃculty in obtaining satisfactory
positions.” She also noted that “World War II and committee work ﬁlled my time,
plus the feeling that what I did in the line of research was not very important made
most of my ‘playthings’ go unpublished. Only a few people do important research.”

Not all of her research went unpublished; in 1941 an article with Ruth B. Rasmusen,
a fellow student of E. P. Lane, appeared in the Bulletin of the AMS.

Beatrice Hagen died at the Ellinwood District Hospital a few days after her
eighty-eighth birthday. She was the last of her immediate family and was survived
by several cousins. She was buried in the Lakin-Comanche District Cemetery in
Ellinwood.
