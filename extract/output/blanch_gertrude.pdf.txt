BLANCH, Gertrude. February 2, 1897–January 1, 1996.
New York University (BS 1932), Cornell University (MS 1934, PhD 1935).

Gertrude Blanch was born Gittel Kaimowitz in Kolno, Poland, which was then
under the control of Russia. She was the last of seven children of Dora (Blanc) and
Wolfe Kaimowitz (also “Kamovitz” and “Kamowitz”). Her father had emigrated
from Poland to the United States early in the century, and he was joined by his
wife, Gittel, and another daughter in 1907. Gittel attended public elementary and
secondary school in Brooklyn, New York, and graduated from the Eastern District
High School at the beginning of 1914, the year her father died. By this time she
had Americanized her ﬁrst name to Gertrude. In order to support her mother she
took a clerical job.

Gertrude Kaimowitz became a naturalized US citizen in 1921. After her mother
died in 1927, she decided to resume her education, so she enrolled in the Washington
Square College of New York University that year and began taking night courses.
She also decided to leave her job working for a hat dealer in increasingly responsible
positions. However, her employer, Jacob Marks, oﬀered to pay her tuition if she
would remain at the job; she accepted the oﬀer and graduated summa cum laude
with a major in mathematics and a minor in physics in 1932. Also in 1932, in
February, she legally changed her name to Gertrude Blanch, an Americanization of
her mother’s name Blanc. Later in 1932 she used the name Gertrude K. Blanch.

When Blanch applied to graduate school at Cornell University, she used as one
of her references Fay Farnum, who had earned her PhD in 1926 from Cornell as a
student of Virgil Snyder and who had joined the faculty at New York University
just before Blanch enrolled there. Blanch entered Cornell in September 1932 and
received her master’s degree in February 1934. She held a graduate scholarship her
ﬁnal year at Cornell and earned her PhD in 1935 after writing a dissertation in
geometry and with minors algebra and analysis.

After receiving her PhD, Blanch returned to New York City and spent a year
as a tutor at Hunter College replacing a faculty member on leave. She then took a
job as a bookkeeper in Manhattan and, in order to remain mathematically active,
took an evening course in relativity at Brooklyn College. The instructor of the
course was Arnold N. Lowan. When Lowan learned that she had a doctorate in
mathematics he invited her to join the WPA project that he had been asked to
head. Although Blanch had no training in numerical analysis she had experience
as an oﬃce manager and with oﬃce calculating machines. Thus, it was appropriate
that she was hired to supervise the training of high school graduates to make
sophisticated mathematical tables using only pencil and paper. At the beginning of
1938, Blanch became a mathematician for the Mathematical Tables Project in New
York. In a 1973 interview her colleague Ida Rhodes described Blanch’s method of
writing detailed work sheets that could be followed one step at a time by people who
had no mathematical training. She claimed that Blanch “did accomplish miracles.
There is no doubt about that. It wasn’t just the question of teaching those people,
who never heard [that numbers have signs, how to compute.] That was an important
thing, but not her most important [deed.] The [crowning accomplishment] was the
raising of the morale of these people who had [felt] rejected by society and [thought]
they were useless” (Tropp interview, 2, square brackets in the original).

Blanch worked for the project until 1942, spending the last two years as a tutor
in the evening session of Brooklyn College. In 1942 she, along with many of the
professional staﬀ of the Mathematical Tables Project, became employees of the
National Bureau of Standards (NBS) contracted to the Applied Mathematics Panel
of the National Defense Research Committee. During this period Blanch applied for
and was denied security clearance based mainly on the fact that her sister, in whose
apartment she lived, was a member of the Communist Party. In 1946 Blanch was
invited to join the staﬀ at Los Alamos but was again denied a security clearance
and remained with the Mathematical Tables Project. The group continued working
in New York and was disbanded after the war. In 1948 Blanch went to California,
still as an employee of NBS, as assistant director for computing at the Institute for
Numerical Analysis (INA) located on the campus of UCLA. During the McCarthy
era, she was again investigated, this time by a loyalty board of the Department of
Commerce, which oversaw the NBS. David Alan Grier reports in his 2005 book that
a May 1952 “hearing resolved the charges against Blanch and allowed her to return
to her job” (308–09). With her loyalty no longer questioned, the following year she
served as a US representative to a symposium on automated digital computing held
at the British National Physics Laboratory.

Although Blanch was cleared of disloyalty, other employees of the INA remained
under attack, and the Institute closed in June 1954. Blanch left at the end of 1953
and worked for the Electrodata Corporation, a section of the Consolidated Engi-
neering Company in Pasadena, which was soon to be bought by the Burroughs Cor-
poration. At the end of 1954 she became a senior mathematician at the Aerospace
Research Laboratories at the Wright Air Development Center (later Division) of
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. At this time she was granted
security clearance.

Blanch remained at Wright-Patterson until her retirement in 1967. She later
said, “I was never as happy in any other place as I was at Wright Field. I had
complete freedom to do exactly what I wanted the way I wanted to do it and,
I think, my best work was done there” (Tropp interview 1973). The Air Force
recognized her accomplishments by awarding Blanch a Special Service Certiﬁcate
in 1963 and a Senior Citizen Award the following year. Also during this period she
continued her work on Mathieu functions and published extensively in this area,
including the contribution on the subject to the 1964 NBS-sponsored Handbook of
Mathematical Functions. At the base she taught mathematics to oﬃcers needing
training in aerodynamics. She was active in the Dayton branch of the AAUW and
was higher education chairman in at least 1963.

Starting in the 1940s, Blanch made signiﬁcant contributions to many volumes of
tables that do not bear her name as an author but were brought out by the WPA
Mathematical Tables Project and later by the National Bureau of Standards com-
putation laboratory. While she was at INA and Wright AFB Blanch supervised the
computations for many projects that resulted in publications or technical reports
in which her assistance was acknowledged. In addition, she contributed to research
in other ways by reviewing and assisting editors. Soon after the National Research
Council journal Mathematical Tables and Other Aids to Computation was begun in
1946, Blanch began contributing reviews to the section RMT (Recent Mathemat-
ical Tables). In 1955 the section became known as “Reviews and Descriptions of
Tables and Books,” and Blanch continued to contribute reviews, as she did when

the journal changed its name to Mathematics of Computation in 1960. In the 1960s
she started contributing to the Mathematical Reviews; her forty-second and last
review appeared in 1987. In addition to refereeing for various journals, Blanch also
served as organizational representative from Wright Air Development Center to the
SIAM Review during its ﬁrst ﬁve years, 1959–63.

On March 3, 1964, Blanch received the Federal Woman’s Award. The following
year, when the women’s movement of the 1960s was just beginning, she noted in
an article for the student journal of the NCTM that “frequently letters come to
my desk asking whether there is a place in mathematics for women,” while others
ask if they can “hope to attain recognition, eventually” (1965, 1). She answered
by sketching the careers of Sonya Kovalevsky and Emmy Noether and ended her
article:

Acceptance of minority groups—women or other groupings—comes
when there is need for the service this group can render. The follow-
ing excerpt from Sonya Kovalevsky . . . is worth quoting: “I received
. . . an article by Strindberg, in which he proves, as decidedly as two
and two make four, what a monstrosity is a woman who is professor
of mathematics, and how unnecessary, injurious, and out of place
she is. I think he is right au fond; only I wish he would prove clearly
that there were plenty of mathematicians in Sweden better than I
am and that it was only galanterie which made them select me!”

Even today, the man would probably be preferred by most em-
ployers over an equally competent woman. However, the prospects
ahead are for many more positions than there are applicants to ﬁll
them. In such a climate, there can be no eﬀectual discrimination.
There is no essential handicap to a career by a women; we look for-
ward to a crop of women scientists, to perhaps disprove Strindberg’s
judgment of them. (1965, 4)

At her retirement in 1967 the Aerospace Research Laboratories published the
Blanch Anniversary Volume: A Series of Papers Presented on the Occasion of her
Retirement by the Friends of Gertrude Blanch. One of her closest colleagues, Ida
Rhodes, commenting on Blanch’s receiving the Federal Woman’s Award, said that
“if I had anything to do with awarding medals, I would have given her [one] made all
of diamonds for the early work that she did, in welding a malnourished, dispirited
crew of people, coming from [the] Welfare Rolls, [into] a group that Leslie J. Comrie
said was the ‘mightiest computing team the world had ever seen’ ” (Tropp interview
with Ida Rhodes 1973, 2, square brackets in the original).

Even in retirement Blanch continued her involvement with mathematics beyond
writing reviews. Until 1970 she was an Air Force consultant through a contract
with Ohio State University. She then returned to California where, in 1973, she was
writing a book on numerical analysis for people who had computational experience
but did not understand the numerical processes involved. At that time she expected
it to take her ﬁve years to ﬁnish it. The unpublished manuscript is in her papers
at the Charles Babbage Institute.

Gertrude Blanch died in San Diego on New Year’s Day 1996, a month before her

ninety-ninth birthday.
