GARVIN, Sister Mary Cleophas. December 11, 1899–January 16, 1990.
Fordham University (BS 1927), Saint Louis University (MS 1931, PhD 1934).

Sister Mary Cleophas Garvin was born Linetta Anna Garvin in Vickery, Ohio,
the daughter of Odelia Margaret (Wilhelm) (1873–1962) and Austin Edward Garvin
(1868–1926), natives of Ohio. Her mother was a housewife; her father was a meat
dealer in 1900, a salesman in a meat market in 1910, and a foreman in an auto
factory, Willys-Overland Company, in Toledo, Ohio, in 1920. She had one older
sister, Lucille (1898–1923), and four younger brothers: Paul J. (1901–1986), Austin
E. (1902–1986), Norbert J. (1904–1979), and Cleophus (1910–1914).

Garvin attended grade school at St. Ann’s and high school at Notre Dame Acad-
emy, both in Toledo. She graduated from high school in May 1917 and entered the
Congregation of the Sisters of Notre Dame in Cleveland, Ohio, on July 2, 1917.
Her investment was on January 2, 1918, her ﬁrst vows on January 2, 1920, and her
ﬁnal vows on January 1, 1923, in Cleveland. Her religious name, Mary Cleophas,
was chosen in memory of her brother who died at age four when she was eleven.

Garvin was an instructor in mathematics and physics, as well as religion, history,
and Latin, at Notre Dame High School in Cleveland from 1919 to 1929. While teach-
ing full time, she spent eight years in part-time study completing her undergraduate
work in science, mathematics, and education. She had extension courses at Notre
Dame College and John Carroll University in Cleveland and summer courses at
St. Xavier College (now Xavier University) in Cincinnati, Catholic Sisters College
of the Catholic University of America, University of Notre Dame, and Fordham
University.

After receiving her bachelor’s degree from Fordham in 1927, Sister Mary Cleo-
phas taught for two more years at Notre Dame High School. She had courses in
French and education at Fordham in the summer of 1928 and courses in education
at Columbia University in the summer of 1929. In autumn 1929 she entered Saint
Louis University for full-time graduate study. She spent the next ﬁve years there and
earned a master’s degree in 1931 and a PhD in 1934 with studies in mathematics,
physics, and astronomy. Her doctoral dissertation in analysis was written under the
direction of Francis Regan, who had earned his PhD from Michigan in 1932. She was
Regan’s ﬁrst doctoral student and the second to receive a PhD in mathematics from
Saint Louis University. The published version of her dissertation appeared in the
American Journal of Mathematics, and her results were extended in 1938 and 1944
by Regan’s next two students, Rev. William C. Doyle and Ella C. Marth, whose
dissertations appeared in the Annals of Mathematics and the Duke Mathematical
Journal, respectively.

Immediately after receiving her doctorate, Sister Mary Cleophas returned to the
Cleveland area to serve as professor of mathematics and physics and head of the
science department at Notre Dame College. This college, aﬃliated with the Sisters
of Notre Dame and then primarily for women, awarded its ﬁrst bachelor’s degree
in 1926. Garvin remained as department head until her retirement in about 1976.
She taught until 1975, was chairman of the computer center 1975–76, and was
associated with the computer center until 1977. She also served as superior at the
college 1947–53 and 1958–60.

Sister Mary Cleophas continued to take or audit courses. These included courses
in religion and physics at John Carroll University and courses in mathematics at

Oklahoma State University (NSF institute, summer 1959); the University of Kansas
(summer 1960); and Bowdoin College (summers 1961, 1962). She audited other
courses at the University of Oklahoma and at Seton Hall University.

Among her contributions at the college, besides what was described as her “un-
usual talent for teaching,” were special classes for parents to learn the “new math”
with their children (“Sister Mary Cleophas: An Educator,” 1). She provided ele-
mentary and secondary teachers with information about curricular changes, and
introduced computer science to teachers and college students. In connection with
her interest in computer science, in the late 1960s and early 1970s Sister Mary
Cleophas applied for and received several grants for desktop computers and for
computer-related workshops and institutes, especially for teachers. She also gave
talks at meetings of NCTM. During her last few years at Notre Dame College her
activities were focused mainly on the computer center. The Garvin Computing
Center at Notre Dame College is named after her.

In addition to her professional aﬃliations with national mathematics and physics
associations, Garvin was also a member of the Central Association of Science and
Mathematics Teachers. In 1975 she was made an emeritus member of the Ohio
Council of Teachers of Mathematics; in 1976 she was presented with a life member-
ship.

Garvin’s main intellectual interest outside of mathematics was music. A 1981
article quoted her as saying, “Although mathematics was my ﬁrst interest, music
was a close second. Rarely did I miss an opportunity to attend a good musical
program, especially of the Cleveland Orchestra” (“Keeping in Touch – Sister Mary
Cleophas”).

Excerpts from the obituary that appeared in the Notre Dame College of Ohio

Today emphasize yet another aspect of her life.

Sister Mary Cleophas was ever concerned for the needy and the
poor. In the early years of the college, she served as ﬁnancial aid
advisor for needy students. . . .

She was a charter promoter of the Servants of the Paraclete,
gathering stipends, food, and clothing for needy priests who had
left the active ministry . . . . On Sundays she visited the lonely in a
nursing home . . . .

As the time for retirement from the classroom drew near, her
outreach to the needy increased as she organized the distribution
of bread to the hungry, new and used clothing to the needy, bed
linens to the poor, and vitamins to the malnourished. To assure the
continuation of this work, she founded the Cleveland Co-Workers
of Mother Teresa, a group of 35 men and women who are dedicated
to helping the lonely, the unwanted, and the poor. (p. 1)

Sister Mary Cleophas received the Vincent P. Haas Memorial Award for “putting
Gospel values in action” and the Mayor’s Award for volunteerism in 1985.

After her retirement, Sister Mary Cleophas remained at the college as archivist
before moving to the Provincial House in Chardon, Ohio, in 1985. She died of
pneumonia in the Provincial House Health Care Center in 1990, shortly after a
celebration of her ninetieth birthday. The Sr. Mary Cleophas Award for Excellence
in Mathematics was established at Notre Dame College after her death.
