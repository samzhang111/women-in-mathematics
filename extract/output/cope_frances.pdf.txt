Vassar College (BA 1922), Columbia University (MA 1925), Radcliffe College
(PhD 1932).

Elizabeth Frances Thorndike, known as Frances, was born in New York City,
the eldest child of Elizabeth (Moulton) (b. 1878) and Edward L. Thorndike (1874–
1949), both originally from Massachusetts. She came from a distinguished academic
family. Her mother had taken the four-year classical course at Boston University,
while her father, who had studied with William James at Harvard, earned a PhD
from Columbia in 1898 and became one of the most inﬂuential educational psychol-
ogists of the ﬁrst four decades of the twentieth century. He was on the faculty at
Teachers College, Columbia University, 1904–40; among his numerous books were
one on the psychology of arithmetic and another on the psychology of algebra. Her
father was one of four children, all of whom were college graduates and teachers.
His two brothers were Ashley Horace (1871–1933), who received a PhD in litera-
ture from Harvard in 1898, and (Everett) Lynn (1882–1965), whose 1905 PhD from
Columbia was in history. Both taught at Columbia. His sister, Mildred Thorndike
(1888–1975), was a teacher.

Elizabeth Moulton and Edward L. Thorndike married on August 29, 1900. In
1904, two years after Frances Thorndike’s birth, a second daughter was born but
lived less than two weeks. Three sons followed: Edward Moulton (1905–1991),
Robert Ladd (1910–1990), and Alan Moulton (1918–2006). All of the children even-
tually earned PhD’s: Edward in physics from the California Institute of Technology
in 1930, Robert in psychology from Columbia University in 1935, and Alan in
physics from Harvard University in 1947.

Frances Thorndike ﬁrst attended the Horace Mann School, a private school as-
sociated with Teachers College, Columbia University, that had opened as a coed-
ucational school in 1887 and remained so for about twenty-ﬁve years. Thorndike
also went to the public school in Montrose, New York, and then to Drum Hill
High School in Peekskill, New York. She attended Vassar College and, according to
her father’s biographer, impressed psychologist Margaret Washburne as the most
brilliant student she had ever had. After Thorndike’s graduation from Vassar in
1922, she worked as an engineering assistant at the American Telephone and Tele-
graph Company in New York City 1922–24 and again 1925–27, after taking the
year 1924–25 to earn a master’s degree in mathematics from Columbia University.
Frances Thorndike became instructor of physics at Vassar for the year 1927–28
and studied at Radcliﬀe College in 1928–29 as a Vassar alumnae fellow. On June
29, 1929, Frances Thorndike married Thomas Freeman Cope. Cope was born in
Texas in 1900, earned a bachelor’s degree in 1923 and a master’s degree in 1925
from Tulane University, and received his PhD in mathematics from the University
of Chicago in 1927. He was at Harvard for the year 1928–29 as a National Research
Council fellow. They remained in Cambridge the year after their marriage, he as
instructor of mathematics at Harvard.

In 1930 the Copes moved to Ohio, where T. Freeman Cope was head of the
mathematics department at Marietta College until 1937. Frances T. Cope completed
her work for the PhD at Radcliﬀe as a student of George David Birkhoﬀ in 1932.
The publications resulting from her dissertation continue to be cited in mathematics

and physics literature. The Copes had three children: Freeman Widener (1930–
1982); Elizabeth Frances, born in 1934; and Mary Thorndike, born in 1935. Freeman
earned an MD from the Johns Hopkins University in 1955, and Elizabeth earned a
PhD from Harvard in psychotherapy in 1963.

Frances Cope was an instructor of mathematics at Vassar College during second
semester 1935–36. In 1937 the family moved to New York, and T. Freeman Cope
joined the faculty at Queens College. He was assistant professor 1937–39, associate
professor 1939–48, professor 1948–70, and department chairman 1937–50 and 1952–
69. He also served as an expert consultant on mathematics tests for the Adjutant
General’s Oﬃce 1944–46. Frances T. Cope served as instructor at Queens in 1941
and at Adelphi College 1941–43.

Frances Cope was a member of the Vassar Club and the auxiliary of the Peek-
skill, New York, Community Hospital. She died suddenly at her home in Montrose,
New York, at age seventy-nine in 1982. She was survived by her husband, three chil-
dren, seven grandchildren, and three brothers. T. Freeman Cope died in Rochester,
Minnesota, two years later.
