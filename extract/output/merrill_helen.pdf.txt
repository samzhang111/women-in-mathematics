MERRILL, Helen A. March 30, 1864–May 2, 1949.
Wellesley College (BA 1886), Yale University (PhD 1903).

Helen Abbot Merrill was born in Orange, New Jersey, the ﬁfth of seven children of
Emily Dodge (Abbot) (1830–1889) and George Merrill (b. 1827). Both of her parents
were born in Massachusetts, her mother in Ipswich and her father in Newburyport;
they married in Brooklyn in 1851. Her ﬁrst American paternal ancestor had arrived
from England in 1633. Her father graduated from high school and was in the life
insurance business, ﬁrst in Newburyport and later in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
In 1860 he was a merchant, in 1870 a dry goods merchant, and in 1880 a grain
merchant. In 1958 he was described as having been an importer, insurance auditor,
and inventor. The other children in the family were: Mary Elizabeth (b. 1852),
George Francis (1857–1858), Francis Gordon (b. 1859), Emily Dodge (b. 1861),
William Pierson (1867–1954), and Robert Dodge (b. 1871). The three sons who
survived to adulthood all graduated from theological seminary.

Merrill attended public schools in Newburyport and in New Brunswick. She took
the classical course as an undergraduate at Wellesley with her main subjects being
mathematics, Greek, Latin, science, and history. At the time she was at Wellesley,
at the end of its ﬁrst decade and start of its second, the mathematics department
had a full four-year curriculum, which was considered one of the strongest in the
college, and the department head was Helen Schafer, who was soon to become the
third president of the college.

Helen Merrill graduated from Wellesley in 1886, the same year as Ellen Pendel-
ton, who was to become a colleague in the mathematics department and Welles-
ley’s sixth president. That same year Winifred Edgerton (Merrill), Wellesley class
of 1883, became the ﬁrst woman in the United States to be granted a PhD in math-
ematics. After her graduation, Helen Merrill taught at the Classical School for Girls
in New York City 1886–89 and at Walnut Lane School in Germantown, Pennsylva-
nia, 1891–93. As a volunteer, she taught mill girls for the Dutch Reformed Church
in New Brunswick in the years 1889–91.

Merrill began her long tenure as a faculty member at Wellesley College in 1893.
During her ﬁrst year teaching she also studied mathematics at Wellesley. She was an
instructor during the period 1893–1901 except for the year 1896–97, when she was
a graduate student at the University of Chicago. Her sister Emily Dodge Merrill
attended Wellesley as a special student 1895–97. Helen Merrill was promoted to
associate professor in 1901 but had a leave of absence from the college for study
at G¨ottingen and for travel in England and Italy during the year 1901–02 and for
study at Yale during the academic year 1902–03. While an associate professor, she
was elected an alumna member of Phi Beta Kappa from Wellesley.

In a letter of August 3, 1902, to Professor Andrew Phillips of Yale, whom she
had met two years earlier, she wrote, “I expect to come to Yale University this
fall for work in Mathematics. There will, I suppose be no formalities necessary for
my admission, as I am a member of the Mathematics Department of Wellesley
College” (Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Yale University, Student Records
(RU 262), Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University Library). During that year
she had courses with James Pierpont in the advanced theory of functions and with
E. R. Hedrick and H. E. Hawkes in partial diﬀerential equations. Although there
appears to be no oﬃcial record of Merrill’s advisor, her name appears on the partial

list of students of James Pierpont in his obituary in the Bulletin of the AMS. The
committee that examined and approved her thesis and record at Yale and that
recommended her for the PhD consisted of P. F. Smith, J. P. Pierpont, and M. B.
Porter, with Pierpont signing for Porter who was then at the University of Texas.
Merrill’s dissertation in analysis concerning solutions of certain types of diﬀerential
equations extends earlier results of Porter, who had earned a PhD at Harvard in
1897 and had been an instructor at Yale 1899–1902. Merrill received her PhD in
1903, and Porter sponsored the presentation of her dissertation results at the 1903
summer meeting in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

During the rest of her career at Wellesley, Merrill was associate professor 1901–
15, professor 1915–31, Lewis Atterbury Stimson professor 1931–32, and professor
emeritus 1932–49. She was chairman of the department from 1916 until her retire-
ment in 1932. She had a leave of absence in 1914–15 for the Napier Conference in
Edinburgh and for travel in Great Britain, Canada, and the United States; she also
attended a summer session at the University of California in 1915. In 1922–23 she
had another leave for work in English university libraries and for travel in France
and Italy.

While on the faculty at Wellesley, Merrill was engaged in many professional and
writing activities. She joined the AMS in October 1903 and was listed in the Janu-
ary 1, 1904, membership list as a life member. She was a particularly active member
of the MAA, which she joined as a charter member in 1916 along with six of her
Wellesley colleagues. She was an associate editor of the American Mathematical
Monthly 1916–19, served on the executive council 1917–19, and was vice president
in 1920, the year the executive council became the board of trustees. Her publica-
tions include a textbook, A First Course in Higher Algebra, coauthored with her
colleague Clara E. Smith, published in 1917. Merrill also wrote mathematical po-
etry and songs, some of which appeared in the Mathematics Teacher. Her highly
acclaimed book, Mathematical Excursions, often used as a source for mathematics
club presentations, was published in 1933 and was reprinted by Dover Publications
in 1958. In 1944, a dozen years after her retirement, she presented to the depart-
ment “A History of The Department of Mathematics, Wellesley College, from the
opening of the College in 1875”; it is currently in the Wellesley archives.

Merrill was also engaged in a number of non-professional activities. In 1914
she reported that she was a member of the College Settlements Association, Con-
sumers’ League, National Child Labor Association, and American Society For Ju-
dicial Settlement of International Disputes. At that time she was a Presbyterian
and indicated that she favored woman suﬀrage. In the summer of 1917 she taught
trigonometry in an aviation camp. She also worked with the College Entrance Ex-
amination Board. She was a member of the Religious Education Association and
the Massachusetts Civic League.

In 1942 she described herself as a Republican and a member of the Congrega-
tional church, formerly a Presbyterian. She also indicated that she enjoyed hand-
iwork, puzzles, and writing. She made four trips to Europe, two for a year each,
the last to France, Italy, and England in 1922–23. Her travel included trips to Nova
Scotia in 1906; to England, Scotland, and Wales in the summers of 1911 and 1914;
to California and the Canadian Rockies in the spring and summer of 1915; and fre-
quent trips to North Carolina. She was also interested in model-making and other
handicrafts, and music.

Helen Merrill died in 1949 of carcinoma at age eighty-ﬁve in her home in Welles-
ley. The funeral was held in the Wellesley College chapel, and she was buried in the
Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. She was survived by two brothers,
the Rev. Dr. William Pierson Merrill, at that time pastor emeritus of the Brick
Presbyterian Church in New York, and the Rev. Robert Dodge Merrill, then of
Seneca Falls, New York. A special AMS fund of $650 was established by her estate
to “use in the interest of mathematical research”; starting in 1971, the descrip-
tion of the fund changed to one that “is available for the use of the Society at the
discretion of the governing bodies” (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 56:558 and 77:1134).
