DALE, Julia. October 16, 1893–January 13, 1936.
Transylvania University (BA 1914), University of Missouri (MA 1921), Cor-
nell University (PhD 1924).

Julia May Dale was born in Shelbyville, Kentucky, the second of six children
of Ida May (Todd) (b. 1867) and James Harrison Dale (1861–1937). Her parents
were both natives of Kentucky and married in 1888. Her siblings were James Todd
(1891–1953), Martha King (b. 1896), Lilly B. (1897–1989), Mary Ida (b. 1903), and
William Pratt (1909–1971). Her father was a farmer and moved with the family
to Alabama in 1916. Julia Dale’s nephew, William Hardin True, noted that both
parents were graduates of Eminence College, a small coeducational college in Ken-
tucky that closed in 1895. He also wrote that James H. Dale served as Kentucky’s
secretary of agriculture and later became a prominent breeder of shorthorn cattle
in Alabama.

Julia Dale graduated from Shelbyville High School in 1910. She then attended
Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky, where she was a class secretary
and was an oﬃcer in the local YWCA and the literary club. She was in charge of
costumes for the girls’ glee club and was a member of Chi Omega, a social sorority.
The senior class prophecy foresees “Julia Dale, as irrepressible as ever, though she
was ‘Math Professor’ at Yale” (The Crimson Yearbook 1914, Transylvania Univer-
sity Special Collections).

After graduating cum laude from Transylvania in 1914, Dale taught for a year in
the high school in Aberdeen, Mississippi. In 1916–18 she taught at William Woods
College, then a junior college for women, in Fulton, Missouri. The dean of the
graduate school at the University of Missouri, Walter Miller, wrote Cornell’s Dean
Creighton on February 18, 1922, that he had “discovered her [at William Woods]
and brought her to the University of Missouri on a graduate scholarship” (Julia
Dale Folder, Box 61, Graduate School Records, Rare and Manuscript Collections,
Cornell University Library). After a year on scholarship, Dale spent the following
three years, 1919–22, as an instructor in mathematics at the University of Missouri
while receiving her master’s degree in 1921.

Dale was admitted to the graduate school at Cornell University as a candidate
for the PhD in September 1922. She was a graduate scholar in mathematics 1922–
23 and an Erastus Brooks fellow in mathematics 1923–24. The address she used
for the December 1924 membership list of the AMS was the Cornell chapter of Chi
Omega, her sorority as an undergraduate at Transylvania University.

After receiving her PhD in 1924, having written a dissertation in analysis and
with minors in geometry and physics, Dale was an instructor for a year at the Uni-
versity of Oklahoma. While there she also volunteered at nearby Native American
reservations. From 1925 until 1930, Dale was head of the mathematics department
at Delta State Teachers College (now Delta State University) in Cleveland, Mis-
sissippi. She was active in the MAA and was secretary-treasurer of the Louisiana-
Mississippi Section in 1929. She was an avid bridge player, did needlepoint, was
interested in athletics, and helped coach the women’s basketball team at Delta
State.

In 1930 Dale moved to Duke University, where she was an assistant professor
and head of the women’s division of mathematics at Duke University. “It is said

that her chief motive in reluctantly leaving Delta State was to accompany her
brother, Billy, then convalescent from a serious illness, who had prepared at [Delta
State] to enter upon graduate study at Duke” (“Recording the Life of Delta State
Teachers College”). Her brother made his home with her and subsequently received
his doctorate in history from Duke in 1941. While at Duke, Dale taught a variety
of classes including some in the graduate school. For example, the announcements
for 1934–35 indicate that she was scheduled to teach courses in Fourier’s Series and
Spherical Harmonics, Inﬁnite Series, and Algebraic Geometry.

Julia Dale died in 1936 at age forty-two in the Duke University hospital of renal
failure after suﬀering from chronic kidney disease for some time. It was reported in
a letter of September 7, 1976, from W. M. Causey of the University of Mississippi
to Professor Miller at Transylvania that she was to have been married to Dr. W.
W. Elliot, a professor of mathematics at Duke University. (Transylvania University
Special Collections) Elliot had been a fellow graduate student and Hurwitz advisee
at Cornell. Dale was survived by her parents, two brothers, and three sisters. Her
remains are interred in Greensboro, Alabama.

In the spring of 1938 friends and relatives established the Julia Dale Memorial
Fund at Duke; the income from this fund supports the Julia Dale Prize awarded
annually by the Department of Mathematics to a mathematics major (or majors)
on the basis of excellence in mathematics.
