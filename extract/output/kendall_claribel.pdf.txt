KENDALL, Claribel. January 23, 1889–April 17, 1965.
University of Colorado (BA 1912, BEd 1912, MA 1914), University of Chicago
(PhD 1921).

Claribel Kendall was born in Denver, Colorado, the daughter of Emma Gano
(Reily) (b. 1859) and Charles Martin Kendall (1860–1906). The 1900 census indi-
cates that both of her parents were born in Ohio and that her father was a lawyer.
However, later census reports show her father as having been born in New York
State, and that is conﬁrmed by additional information. He graduated from Yale
University in 1883 before moving to Colorado, where he married in 1887. In 1900
Claribel Kendall had one living sister, Florence (1890–1971); another sibling had
died earlier. Emma Kendall, a widow, and her two daughters moved from Denver
to Boulder in about 1910. According to census records, Claribel and her mother
were living together in 1920 and 1930.

Claribel Kendall received both her elementary and secondary education in the
Denver public schools. She entered the University of Colorado in Boulder in 1907
and earned both a bachelor of arts and a bachelor of education degree in 1912.
It appears that she taught in public school at least a year before her graduation,
most likely in 1908–09. During 1911–13, her senior year and her ﬁrst year as a
graduate student, she was an assistant in mathematics at Colorado. She became
an instructor in 1913, one year before earning her master’s degree in mathematics,
having studied with Saul Epsteen and Ira M. DeLong. After receiving her master’s
degree, Kendall did graduate work at Colorado during the summers with visiting
faculty Abraham Cohen and B. F. Finkel. During the summers of 1915 and 1918
and from the summer of 1920 to the summer of 1921 she studied at the University
of Chicago with G. A. Bliss, L. E. Dickson, E. H. Moore, and E. J. Wilczynski.
During her ﬁrst two summers she had scholarships; during her extended period of
residence she had a fellowship. She received her PhD from Chicago in September
1921.

Claribel Kendall’s sister, Florence, entered the University of Colorado in 1909.
She received a bachelor’s degree in physics in 1913, after which she was an instructor
of mathematics at the university for at least a year. Later, in 1926, she received a
master’s degree in mathematics from Colorado with a thesis, “The problem of two
and three bodies in celestial mechanics.” She was a high school teacher in Salida,
Colorado, in 1920 before moving to Trinidad, Colorado, where she spent most of
her career as a high school mathematics teacher.

Claribel Kendall remained at the University of Colorado for her entire career
except for 1920–21, the year she had a leave to study at Chicago, and the summer
of 1925, when she taught at the University of California. She was promoted from
instructor to assistant professor in 1922, to associate professor in 1928, and to
professor in 1943, and was the ﬁrst woman to become a professor of mathematics
at Colorado. She served as acting chairman of the department 1954–55. She retired
in 1957 as professor emeritus.

In 1913, a year before she received her master’s degree, a problem contributed by
Kendall on calculus was published in the American Mathematical Monthly. A few
years later, during 1916 and 1917, several of her solutions to problems in the Monthly
were also published. In 1916 she was listed as a charter member of the MAA, and the
following year she was one of ﬁfteen MAA members to attend a meeting to organize

the Rocky Mountain Section of the MAA. During the summer of 1928, Kendall and
her sister attended the International Congress of Mathematicians in Bologna, where
Claribel Kendall was a delegate from the university. Kendall directed the master’s
theses of nine or ten students; one, in 1924, when she was an assistant professor
is not certain since the department did not list master’s advisors until 1928. After
that time she advised three as an associate professor and six as a professor, the
last one in 1955, two years before her retirement. Among these advisees were at
least six women. In addition to her work in the mathematics department, Kendall
was active on various committees in the university. Her obituary lists her service
as secretary of the College of Arts and Sciences committee with power to act on
degrees, her chairmanship of the Bigelow scholarship committee, her work with
the Associated Women Students (AWS) as secretary of their loan and scholarship
committee, and her serving as advisor to the AWS senate, Mortar Board, and the
university Christian Science group.

Kendall was a member of Kappa Delta Pi, an education honorary society. She
was active in the MAA through its Rocky Mountain Section and was president in
1930. She presented papers at meetings of the section in the period 1922–42; they
included several expository papers and the master’s thesis of one of her students.
She was secretary of the Alpha of Colorado chapter of Phi Beta Kappa 1922–64, and
a scholarship in her honor was established by the chapter. She was also secretary,
as well as treasurer and president, of the Colorado Mountain Club. She also had
an interest in bird watching, and at least twice in the 1920s she helped compile the
Boulder Christmas bird census for the Audubon journal, Bird-Lore. She held various
oﬃces, including second reader 1944–47, in the First Church of Christ, Scientist, in
Boulder.

Claribel Kendall was joined in her home in Boulder by her sister, Florence, after
Florence retired in 1956. This was the same residence Claribel had shared with
her mother at the time of the 1930 census. The sisters remained in their home in
Boulder after Claribel Kendall’s retirement in 1957. Claribel and Florence Kendall
both served on the hospitality and recreation committee for the NCTM summer
meeting in Greeley, Colorado, in August 1958.

Claribel Kendall died in 1965 at age seventy-six in Boulder. Both her local Phi
Beta Kappa chapter and her local church were remembered generously in her will.
Florence Kendall was eighty when she died in 1971, and contributions in her memory
were requested to be sent to the Claribel Kendall Memorial Fund, in care of Phi
Beta Kappa at the University of Colorado.
