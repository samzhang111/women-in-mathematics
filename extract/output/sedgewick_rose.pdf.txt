SEDGEWICK, Rose (Whelan). June 16, 1903–June 7, 2000.
Brown University (Women’s College) (PhB 1925), Brown University (MA 1927,
PhD 1929).

Rose Alice Whelan was born in Brockton, Massachusetts, the ﬁfth of six chil-
dren of Mary Theresa (Manchester) (1864–1942) and Daniel Edward Whelan (1868–
1955). Her mother was born in Liverpool, England, immigrated to the United States
in 1868, and was naturalized in 1892. Mary Whelan had no formal higher educa-
tion but loved reading, music, and theater; she handled the family ﬁnances and,
according to her granddaughter Norma Sedgewick Rockel, “managed to ﬁnd the
money needed to give her children a higher education.” Daniel Whelan was born
in Massachusetts, and his formal education stopped at two years of high school; he
was, however, “an omnivorous reader with wide ranging interests” (Rockel corre-
spondence). He worked, mainly as a cutter, in a shoe factory. Norma Rockel also
provided a detailed account of the other children in the family. They were Louise
Manchester (1894–1984), who earned a bachelor’s degree from Teachers College,
Columbia University, and taught school in Massachusetts and New Jersey; Eliza-
beth Harford (1896–1974), who earned a BA and an MA in Guidance from Boston
University and taught school in Brockton, Massachusetts; Daniel Edward Jr. (1897–
1974), who earned a degree in civil engineering from Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and became dean of science at Loyola University in Los Angeles; John
Henry (1900–1926), who went to sea for several years and died at age twenty-six;
and Mary (1907–2000), who earned a BA from Brown University and an MA from
Teachers College, Columbia University, and taught in Maryland and New Jersey.

Rose Whelan received her primary and secondary education in the public schools
of Brockton, Massachusetts. While there she received the Benjamin Franklin Medal
for excellence in American history, an award that her grandmother, Johanna Louney,
had received. After her graduation from Brockton High School in 1921, Whelan en-
tered Women’s College in Brown University (Pembroke College in Brown University
from 1928 until it merged with Brown in 1971). She received the PhB magna cum
laude in 1925, having been elected to Phi Beta Kappa in her junior year.

Whelan remained at Brown University during 1925–26, as a part-time assistant
in the mathematics department and as a graduate student in mathematics. She
taught in the Women’s College before completing the work for her master’s degree
in September 1926. She received the degree in 1927, after having spent the academic
year 1926–27 as a resident fellow at Bryn Mawr College working primarily with
Anna Pell Wheeler. A February 1928 statement of the Department of Mathematics
at Brown regarding Whelan contains a quotation from Wheeler. “Miss Rose Whelan
took two courses with me at Bryn Mawr College during the year ’26–’27. I found
her a keen, thorough student. She has a questioning mind, and insists on settling
all details, but also gets a good grasp of the subject as a whole. It was a great
pleasure to work with her. She will be a clear lecturer, and her personality will
win her students. She is very attractive in appearance and she has good health. Her
interest in Mathematics, and her capacity for work, speak well for her mathematical
career in the future. I have great hopes for Miss Whelan” (R. G. D. Richardson
folder, R. L. Moore Papers, Archives of American Mathematics). It was noted that
she was oﬀered reappointment at Bryn Mawr for the year 1927–28 and that she was

named an alternate for the Margaret E. Maltby fellowship of the AAUW. However,
Whelan returned to Brown for the 1927–28 year as holder of the Arnold fellowship.
Whelan also taught a section of freshmen at Women’s College while studying for
her doctorate and writing her dissertation on boundary value problems in diﬀeren-
tial equations under the direction of J. D. Tamarkin. In a letter of February 1928,
R. G. D. Richardson, head of the department and dean of the graduate school at
Brown, observed that Whelan would probably be ﬁnished by September 1928, that
the dissertation should be publishable, and also that she had taught three summers
at her former high school in Brockton, Massachusetts. He wrote, “She is one of the
promising young women in Mathematics in the country. I wish it were possible to
keep her here, but there seems no opening commensurate with her abilities. The
department recommends her unreservedly for any position for which her experience
and training ﬁt her” (R. G. D. Richardson folder, R. L. Moore Papers).

During 1928–29 Whelan was an instructor at the University of Rochester and was
suﬃciently near the completion of her doctoral work that an abbreviated version
of her dissertation appeared in the Bulletin of the AMS in January 1929. Her 1929
degree was the ﬁrst PhD in mathematics granted by Brown. After receiving her
doctorate, Whelan continued to teach at the University of Rochester. She was an
instructor until 1932 and an assistant professor 1932–34.

On December 25, 1932, Rose Whelan and Charles Hill Wallace Sedgewick were
married in Brockton, Massachusetts. Charles H. W. Sedgewick was born in Nova
Scotia on August 21, 1902. He had worked as a bookkeeper and teller for a bank
in Nova Scotia from 1917 to 1921 and as a high school teacher for two years after
completing his bachelor’s degree at Dalhousie University in 1925. In 1927 Sedgewick
went to Brown, where he was an assistant, instructor, and then fellowship holder
until 1932. He received his master’s degree in mathematics in 1930 and continued
his studies there until 1932, when he accepted an instructorship at Connecticut
Agricultural College (from 1933 Connecticut State College and since 1939 the Uni-
versity of Connecticut) at Storrs.

After their marriage Rose Sedgewick returned to her teaching position in Roch-
ester, New York, and Charles Sedgewick returned to his position in Storrs, Con-
necticut. In October 1933 Mary Elizabeth (Malia), the ﬁrst of their four children,
was born in Willimantic, Connecticut, near Storrs. In 1934 C. H. W. Sedgewick
received his PhD in mathematics from Brown, he was promoted to assistant profes-
sor at Connecticut, and Rose Sedgewick gave up her position at Rochester. Their
three other children were also born in Willimantic. They are Norma Louise, born in
December 1935; John, born in July 1940; and Robert, born in December 1946. All
of the children earned bachelor’s degrees: Malia from the University of Connecticut
in 1956, Norma with a major in physics from Bryn Mawr in 1956, and John and
Robert with mathematics majors from Brown in 1962 and 1968, respectively. Malia
also earned an MA from Vanderbilt University and an EdD from the University of
Hawaii in 1987, and Robert earned an MA from Brown in 1969 and a PhD from
Stanford in 1975. All have had careers: Malia as a professor of nursing, Norma as
an electronic systems engineer, John as a mathematician, and Robert as professor
of computer science.

Charles Sedgewick remained at the University of Connecticut until 1958. He was
assistant professor 1934–41, associate professor 1941–46, and professor 1946–58.
Rose Sedgewick was an instructor at Connecticut for some years beginning in 1943

and ending in 1956. She also taught at Hillyer College (now part of the University
of Hartford) 1955–58.

In 1958 C. H. W. Sedgewick moved to the US Census Bureau in Suitland, Mary-
land, where he was a member of the staﬀ of the industrial division 1958–61, chief
of the foods section 1961–70, and supervisor of statistics from 1970 until his retire-
ment. Rose W. Sedgewick was hired as an instructor at the University of Maryland
in 1958 and was promoted to assistant professor in 1961; she retired at that rank
in 1969.

The Sedgewicks’ daughter, Norma, wrote in 2000 that her parents played contract
bridge and were both life masters in the American Contract Bridge League. She
also wrote that her mother “was an avid reader, as were all the Whelans, and read
a book almost every day, even well into her 90s.”

The Sedgewicks moved from Maryland to Dunedin, on the west coast of Florida,
in 1971. Two of Rose Sedgewick’s sisters, Louise Whelan and Mary Whelan, also
eventually retired to Dunedin; Louise died there in 1984. Charles H. W. Sedgewick
died in Dunedin at the age of eighty-six on November 5, 1988.

Rose W. Sedgewick was living at the Mease Continuing Care facility in Dunedin
where she died suddenly of a heart attack in June 2000, shortly before her ninety-
seventh birthday. Her sister Mary had died in the same facility just six weeks ear-
lier. Rose Sedgewick was a member of St. Michael the Archangel Catholic Church in
nearby Clearwater, Florida. She was survived by her four children and ten grandchil-
dren. In October 2001, the Rose Whelan Society was founded at Brown University
as an organization for women graduate students and postdoctoral appointees in
mathematics and applied mathematics.
