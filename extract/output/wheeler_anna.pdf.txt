WHEELER, Anna (Johnson) Pell. May 5, 1883–March 26, 1966.
University of South Dakota (BA 1903), University of Iowa (MA 1904), Rad-
cliffe College (MA 1905), University of Chicago (PhD 1910).

Anna Johnson was born in Calliope (now Hawarden), Iowa, the youngest of three sur-
viving children of four born to Amelia (Friberg or Frieberg) (1854–1935) and Andrew
Gustav Johnson (1846–1920), both from Skaraborgl¨an, W¨asterg¨otland, Sweden. Her par-
ents had each immigrated to the United States in 1872, married several years after their
arrival, and settled in Union Creek in Dakota Territory. Her father ﬁrst farmed but later
was a furniture dealer and undertaker. Her sister, Esther Carolina (1879–1979), and her
brother, Elmer (b. 1881), were both born in Dakota Territory. In 1882 the family moved
to Iowa, ﬁrst Calliope and then, in about 1891, to nearby Akron. Anna Johnson attended
public school in Akron and graduated from high school there in 1899. According to Esther
Johnson’s granddaughter Nancy J. Owens, who spoke at an AWM-sponsored symposium
in honor of her great aunt, Amelia Johnson regretted not having received an education
and sent her two daughters, but not her son, to college.

In 1899 Anna Johnson entered the University of South Dakota in Vermillion, about
twenty-ﬁve miles from Akron; her sister, Esther, had entered the previous year. Anna
ﬁrst took courses that allowed her to complete the formal entrance requirements of the
school. When the census was taken in early June 1900, she was enumerated as a boarder
in Vermillion and with her family in Akron, where her father was a furniture dealer, her
sister was a school teacher, and her brother was a day laborer.

Anna Johnson continued her studies at South Dakota, where her mathematical talent
was recognized by Alexander Pell, who “found his prodigy” after seeing her approach to
an original geometry problem he had assigned (Hardesty and Unruh, “The Enigma of
Degaev-Pell,” 17). Pell and his wife, Emma, took several students, among them Anna and
Esther Johnson, into their home to live.

With Pell’s strong encouragement, Johnson graduated from South Dakota in 1903 and
went to the University of Iowa on a scholarship. She received her master’s degree in 1904
and then went to Radcliﬀe College with a scholarship. She received her second master’s
degree in 1905. Still on scholarship she stayed at Radcliﬀe until 1906, when she went to the
university in G¨ottingen on an Alice Freeman Palmer fellowship from Wellesley College.
On July 9, 1907, she married Alexander Pell in G¨ottingen. Pell’s ﬁrst wife had died in
December 1904, and he and Johnson had remained in contact over the years.

Pell was born Sergei Petrovich Degaev in 1857 in Moscow, Russia. After attending
military schools Degaev received an army commission in 1876. He retired from the service
in 1879 and entered engineering school in St. Petersburg. Toward the end of 1880 he joined
the People’s Will, a group that was responsible for the assassination of Tsar Alexander
II in March 1881. Degaev was among those arrested but was released a few weeks later.
He graduated in June and married Liubov Nikolavena Ivanova in November 1881. His
subsequent activities in, and escape from, Tsarist Russian were described in a 1972 article,
“The Enigma of Degaev-Pell,” and were more fully depicted in a 2003 monograph, The
Degaev Aﬀair. In November 1882 Degaev was sent to Odessa by the People’s Will to
set up a printing press and was soon arrested there. He contacted the head of the secret
police, Georgii Sudeikin, hoping, according to his sister, “to achieve revolutionary goals
through the government” (Pipes, The Degaev Aﬃar, 67); he became a collaborator and
was allowed to escape. However, upon the arrest of many members of the People’s Will,
Degaev confessed his collaboration to this group, promised to assassinate Sudeikin, and
did so in December 1883. After the assassination Degaev was expelled from the People’s
Will but was oﬀered money to travel to America. Furthermore, in February 1884 the
Russian authorities circulated a poster with his picture and oﬀered a signiﬁcant reward.

Degaev and his wife ﬂed to England and then came to North America. This part of his
life was described in a 1921 obituary by Charlotte Scott:

His early history is that of so many of his compatriots in that sorely
disturbed country, driven into futile revolutionary courses by his patri-
otism and forced by failure to leave his native land. . . . Apparently he
went from place to place, doing whatever he could ﬁnd to do; one of his
earliest jobs was in a printing oﬃce in a small Canadian village. These
early struggles must have occupied a few years before he went to St.
Louis, where he secured a position in a chemical factory in 1886. (“Dr.
Alexander Pell,” Bryn Mawr College News, 9 Feb 1921, 2)

In 1891 Degaev and his wife, using the names Alexander and Emma Pell, became US
citizens, and Alexander Pell began his study of mathematics at Washington University in
St. Louis under the direction of C. M. Woodward. He began graduate studies at Johns
Hopkins University in 1895 and was awarded his PhD in 1897. He was appointed pro-
fessor at South Dakota that year and not long afterwards had Anna Johnson as a pupil.
Thus, despite “his constant fear of revolutionary retribution” (Pipes, 119), Pell traveled
to G¨ottingen in the summer of 1907 in order to marry his prot´eg´e. Both Alexander and
Anna Pell returned to the United States in August.

The year 1907 also marked the opening of the University of South Dakota’s School of
Engineering and the appointment of Pell as its ﬁrst dean. Anna J. Pell taught at South
Dakota during the fall semester of 1907 and returned alone to G¨ottingen in the spring
of 1908. In August 1908, Alexander Pell, who had been starred in the 1906 edition of
American Men of Science, resigned from his position as dean of the College of Engineering
at South Dakota and took a position as an assistant professor at the Armour Institute of
Technology (now Illinois Institute of Technology) in Chicago. In December 1908, when she
was almost ready to take her ﬁnal examination with David Hilbert in G¨ottingen, Anna
J. Pell returned to the United States without her degree and in January 1909 enrolled at
the University of Chicago.

Anna J. Pell received her PhD magna cum laude in 1910 from the University of Chicago.
While she was oﬃcially a student of E. H. Moore, she wrote at the time that her disser-
tation, in the new ﬁeld of functional analysis, had been written independently while in
G¨ottingen. Moore was unable to secure Anna Pell a position at a research institution, so
she remained in Chicago and taught a class at the university during the fall. In January
1911, Alexander Pell, by then an associate professor at the Armour Institute, suﬀered a
stroke while teaching. Anna J. Pell substituted for her husband for the remainder of the
semester. His only teaching after the stroke was for a semester at Northwestern University
in 1915–16.

In the fall of 1911 Anna Pell became an instructor at Mount Holyoke College in Mas-
sachusetts. In 1914 she was promoted to associate professor. Four years later she moved
to Bryn Mawr College as associate professor to ﬁll the vacancy created when Olive C.
Hazlett went to Mount Holyoke College. Bryn Mawr, whose mathematics department was
headed by Charlotte A. Scott, had a more active department than Mount Holyoke and
also had a PhD program. The department’s journal club met regularly, and Anna Pell was
an active participant, often giving both the ﬁrst and last talks of the semester.

Early in 1921 Alexander Pell died. That same year the third edition of American Men
of Science appeared with Anna J. Pell starred. The following year, Anna Pell’s ﬁrst PhD
student, Margaret Buchanan (Cole), earned her degree. In 1923 Pell was appointed to the
American Mathematical Society’s committee on policy and budget. Later that year the
AMS was incorporated and she was appointed to the original board of trustees, which
consisted of thirty-one members; Anna J. Pell and Clara E. Smith of Wellesley College
were the only women on the board. While neither Pell nor Smith was elected in 1924 to
the smaller ﬁve-member board of trustees, Pell was elected to serve on the council of the

AMS for 1924–26. Also, in 1923 Pell became the ﬁrst woman to deliver an invited address
at a meeting of the AMS; the next was delivered by Emmy Noether in 1934.

Pell became head of the department after Charlotte Scott’s retirement in 1924. She was
named Alumnae Professor of Mathematics the following year. In July 1925 she married
Arthur Leslie Wheeler (1861–1932), a Connecticut-born, Yale-educated classicist who had
been on the faculty at Bryn Mawr since 1900 and who was widowed before Pell joined the
Bryn Mawr faculty. Before their marriage, Arthur Wheeler had accepted a professorship
at Princeton University. Their marriage was announced in the Bulletin of the AMS, which
notes, “they will continue to occupy their professorships and they will be at home after
this fall in Princeton and in Bryn Mawr” (31 (1925): 573). Shortly before her marriage
to Wheeler, Anna Pell made a contribution in honor of Alexander Pell to the society’s
endowment fund.

In 1927 D. V. Widder, an associate on the Bryn Mawr mathematics faculty, was pro-
moted to associate professor, thus allowing Anna Pell Wheeler to become a non-resident
lecturer, teach only part time, and live full time in Princeton, New Jersey. She continued
this arrangement for the next four years except for a year spent in Europe. While still
living in Princeton, she returned to her professorship in 1931 when Widder, who later mar-
ried one of Wheeler’s doctoral students, left for a position at Harvard. The following year
Arthur Wheeler died and Anna Pell Wheeler moved back to Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.

While she was married to Arthur Wheeler, Anna Pell Wheeler was particularly active
in both the AMS and the MAA. In addition to ﬁnishing her term on the AMS council,
in 1926 she served on the ﬁrst MAA Chauvenet Prize committee and the following year
began a ﬁfteen-year appointment as an associate editor of the Annals of Mathematics
representing the MAA. She directed three dissertations while she lived in Princeton (Mar-
ion Cameron Gray 1926, Laura Guggenb¨uhl 1927, and Rose Lucile Anderson 1930). In
1927 Wheeler became the ﬁrst woman to deliver the AMS colloquium lectures; the next
by a woman were delivered in 1980 by Julia Robinson. Wheeler’s lectures do not appear
in the Colloquium Publication Series although after Arthur Wheeler’s death she appar-
ently planned to rewrite them in book form. After his death in 1932, Anna Pell Wheeler
published only one more paper, that in 1935.

After Wheeler’s return to full-time teaching, Bryn Mawr joined the University of Penn-
sylvania and Swarthmore College in a cooperative plan for graduate study. Wheeler hired
strong research faculty during the 1930s. Gustav A. Hedlund was at Bryn Mawr from 1930
to 1939; Emmy Noether joined the Bryn Mawr faculty in 1933, became a close friend of
Wheeler, and remained until her death in April 1935; Nathan Jacobson stayed only 1935–
36; and Hilda Geiringer came in 1939 and stayed until 1944, leaving soon after marrying
Richard von Mises of Harvard. During this period Wheeler supervised four more disserta-
tions (Olive Margaret Hughes 1934, Vera Ames (Widder) 1938, Dorothy Maharam (Stone)
1940, and Josephine Mitchell (1942). She also served on the College Entrance Examina-
tion Board Commission on Examinations in Mathematics that was appointed in 1933 and
reported early in 1935. Later she served several terms on the AMS committee to deter-
mine the use of interest accrued from special funds and was chairman of the Philadelphia
Section of the MAA in 1944.

Two women’s colleges, New Jersey College for Women and Mount Holyoke College,
awarded Wheeler honorary DSc degrees, in 1932 and 1937, respectively. Letters written
at the time of her retirement in 1948 and talks given at a symposium about her life and
work in 1980 indicate that she treated her students and young faculty to the same type of
care and encouragement that she had received from Alexander and Emma Pell when she
was a student. In 2006 Anna Pell Wheeler was one of forty-ﬁve women mathematicians
featured with an individual poster containing a brief biography at the “Connecting Women
in Mathematics Across Canada” workshop held at the Fields Institute. She and Grace
Bareis were the only two women in our study so honored.

After her retirement Anna Pell Wheeler continued to live in Bryn Mawr but spent
summers in a cottage, named QED, that she and Arthur Wheeler had bought in St.
Hubert’s, New York, in the Adirondack Mountains. She also spent some time in northern
California, attending section meetings of the MAA in San Francisco in January 1949 and
1951. In 1953 she endowed a mathematics scholarship at the University of South Dakota
honoring Alexander Pell. In 1960 anonymous gifts in honor of Anna Pell Wheeler and in
memory of Charlotte Angas Scott established funds for prizes awarded annually in their
names. Anna Pell Wheeler was eighty-two when she died in Bryn Mawr in March 1966
a few months after suﬀering a stroke. She is buried next to Alexander Pell in the Lower
Merion Baptist Church Cemetery in Bryn Mawr, which accepts members of all faiths for
burial.
