NEE, Henrietta (Terry). December 30, 1904–June 5, 1981.
Shurtleff College (BS 1926), University of Illinois (MA 1929, PhD 1934).

Henrietta Pearl Terry was born in Virden, Illinois, the seventh of eight surviving
children of nine born to Mary Etta (Kirwin) (b. 1867) and Herman R. Terry (b.
1863), both natives of Illinois. According to the census reports of both 1900 and
1910, Herman Terry was a farmer living in central Illinois. By 1920 the family had
moved to the Alton area, near the Mississippi River, and no occupation was listed
for Herman. Henrietta Terry’s siblings were Vincent Kirwin (1890–1970), Carl (b.
1892), Albert (b. 1894), Mabel (b. 1896), Clyde Norton (b. 1897), Russell (b. ca.
1903), and Charles Everly (1908–1992).

Henrietta Terry graduated from Alton Community High School in Alton, Illi-
nois, in 1922 and attended the local Shurtleﬀ College, a Baptist college that closed
and was later absorbed by Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville. After she
received her bachelor’s degree in 1926 with a major in mathematics, she taught for
two years in the high school in Patterson, Illinois. She then did a year of graduate
work at the University of Illinois, received her master’s degree in 1929, and taught
at Muscatine Junior College (now Muscatine Community College) in Iowa for the
ﬁrst two years after the college was established.

In 1931 Terry returned to the University of Illinois for further graduate study.
Her dissertation in the theory of ﬁnite groups was directed by H. R. Brahana,
who had come to the department at Illinois immediately after receiving his PhD
from Princeton in 1920. Although the abstract of her dissertation was accepted for
publication in the American Journal of Mathematics, it was transferred to the Duke
Journal of Mathematics and appeared in the ﬁrst issue of that journal. After Terry
received her doctorate in 1934 with a minor in chemistry, she taught for one year
at the American College for Girls in Turkey. Upon her return she was an instructor
in mathematics at the University of Illinois High School, Urbana. She was elected
to membership in the AMS her ﬁrst year on the faculty there. She remained at the
university high school until she took a leave for war service in 1942. She enlisted
in the WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service), the Women’s
Reserve of the US Naval Reserve, did her basic training at Smith College, trained
in weather forecasting at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and served at
the Norfolk Naval Air Station in Virginia, where she was an aerologist stationed
in the weather bureau there. She accompanied ﬂight crews and was also trained to
ﬂy. She became a lieutenant (jg) and later a full lieutenant before her discharge on
December 1, 1945.

On December 22, 1945, Henrietta Terry married Raymond Moore Nee, an engi-
neer. Born in Portsmouth, Virginia, in 1903, Raymond Nee received a bachelor’s
degree from Lynchburg College, a master’s degree from Virginia Polytechnic In-
stitute, and a certiﬁcate in electrical engineering from Lowell Institute. He held
various positions with American Cyanamid Company in Wayne, New Jersey, and
worked as a private consultant after his retirement.

The Nees had a daughter, Rayetta Terry, born in 1948. Late in 1951 they had a
house built in Upper Nyack, a village on the Hudson River in southern New York
State. Except for the year 1955–56, when they lived in Argentina, they lived in that
house until after Henrietta Nee’s death. Henrietta Nee, who used the name Terry

Nee, was described by her daughter as athletic; she was interested in horseback
riding as a girl and played tennis during her high school years. Later she was active
in a number of local community groups. They included AAUW (for which she was
president), the League of Women Voters, PTA, the Nyack Garden Club, and the
Nyack Morning Music Club. She was also a board trustee of the Nyack Library and
was involved with the Nyack Hospital thrift shop. She played piano and enjoyed
going to concerts and plays.

Their daughter, Rayetta Nee, graduated as a mathematics major from Bryn
Mawr College in 1969, studied mathematics for a year at Oxford University, and
was a tax attorney in New York City after studying at the Harvard Law School
and receiving an LLM in 1974 from the NYU School of Law.

H. Terry Nee died at age seventy-six in the Nyack Hospital in 1981 after a lengthy
illness. She was survived by her husband, her daughter, four brothers, and several
nieces and nephews, and was buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Norfolk, Virginia.
In lieu of ﬂowers, contributions were asked for the Nyack Library, Nyack Hospital, or
other charity. The H. Terry Nee Book Fund at Bryn Mawr College was established
as a memorial fund by her husband and her daughter. Her husband died in 1990
and her daughter at age ﬁfty-one in 1999.
