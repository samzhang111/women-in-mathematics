CRONIN, Sarah Elizabeth. July 1, 1877–October 2, 1958.
University of Iowa (BS 1903, MS 1905), Columbia University (PhD 1917).

Sarah Elizabeth Cronin was the youngest of nine (living) children of Deborah
(ca. 1838–ca. 1918) and Cornelius Cronin (ca. 1830–ca. 1917), a farmer in north-
east Iowa. Her parents had emigrated from Ireland in the mid-nineteenth century
before their marriage. She was born in Iowa, probably in Allamakee County in the
northeast corner of the state. Census records indicate that her siblings were John
(b. ca 1860), June (b. ca. 1862), Timothy (b. ca. 1864), Catherine (b. ca. 1865),
Johanna (b. ca. 1868), William (b. ca. 1869), Lucy (b. ca. 1884), and James (b. ca.
1885).

According to US census records, in 1900 Sarah Cronin was a school teacher
and living in Cherokee County, in western Iowa, with her parents. She received
her undergraduate degree in 1903 from the University of Iowa (oﬃcially the State
University of Iowa) in Iowa City, and in April of that year the university awarded
her a scholarship in mathematics to continue her studies. However, the following
fall she was teaching mathematics in the Creston, Iowa, high school. After a year
she returned to the University of Iowa as a fellow in mathematics and received her
master’s degree in 1905.

Cronin was instructor of mathematics at Iowa State College of Agriculture and
Mechanic Arts (now Iowa State University of Science and Technology) in Ames
1905–07. She was then instructor at the University of Iowa 1907–15, although she
apparently had a leave of absence 1913–15, when she was a graduate student at
Columbia University. She received her PhD from Columbia in 1917 with a dis-
sertation written under the direction of Edward Kasner. Cronin returned to the
University of Iowa as assistant professor in 1915 and remained for three years.

In 1918 Cronin went to the Equitable Life Assurance Society in New York (now
the AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company) as chief of the policy change division.
The following year she passed the ﬁrst two parts of the associate examinations
of the Actuarial Society of America. Cronin passed the third and fourth parts in
1922 and 1923 and was then enrolled as an associate of the society. She kept her
membership in the society through 1940.

Sarah E. Cronin lived in Forest Hills, Queens, before her retirement in 1942,
when she moved to Daytona Beach, Florida. She was eighty-one when she died in
Halifax Hospital in Daytona Beach in 1958.
