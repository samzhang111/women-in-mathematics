WILSON, Hazel (Schoonmaker). October 31, 1888–April 23, 1988.
Wellesley College (BA 1911), Radcliffe College (MA 1914), Cornell Univer-
sity (PhD 1927).

Hazel Edith Schoonmaker was the daughter of Christiana M. (Abele), born in 1859
in Pennsylvania, and Arthur Twing Schoonmaker, born in 1860 in Massachusetts. Her
parents were married in about 1885; she was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the elder
of two children. Her younger brother, Ernest (1894–1974), was also born in Philadelphia
and later became a dentist. Her father graduated from the Hahnemann Medical College of
Philadelphia in 1894; shortly thereafter the family was living in Westﬁeld, Massachusetts,
where her father was described variously as a homeopathist, a physician, and a surgeon
with a specialty in diseases of women and children.

Hazel Schoonmaker graduated from high school in Westﬁeld before she entered Welles-
ley College, from which she graduated in 1911 with a major in mathematics and a minor
in German. She taught in high school in Massachusetts 1912–13 before entering Radcliﬀe
College for graduate work. After receiving her master’s degree from Radcliﬀe in 1914,
Schoonmaker taught in high school in New York for a year and was acting associate pro-
fessor at Denison University in Granville, Ohio, the following year, 1915–16. She taught
in high schools in New York 1916–17 and in Pennsylvania 1917–19. During 1920 she was
professor at McKendree College in Lebanon, Illinois; in 1920–21 she was acting professor
at Augustana College, Rock Island, Illinois; and in 1921–22 she was professor at Gulf Park
College for Women, a two-year school that had recently opened in Long Beach, Missis-
sippi. The summer of 1922 she studied at Columbia University and then spent three years
as professor at Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio.

Schoonmaker ﬁrst attended Cornell University in the summer session of 1924; in her
application for admission of July that year she reported that she had done four and
a half years of college teaching. She began full-time study there in 1925 and remained
at Cornell until 1928. She was appointed a scholar for 1926–27 and received her PhD
in 1927 with a major geometry, ﬁrst minor analysis, and second minor education. She
remained at Cornell as resident doctor for a year after she received her doctorate, taking
two mathematics courses and preparing typed notes for a course she had taken from Virgil
Snyder on plane cubic curves. Those notes are now in the archives at Cornell.

After leaving Cornell, Wilson was an assistant professor 1928–31 at the New Jersey
College for Women, the public coordinate college for women associated with Rutgers Uni-
versity in New Brunswick. While there she published three papers in algebraic geometry:
her dissertation; a paper coauthored with H. C. Shaub, a fellow student of Snyder at Cor-
nell; and a paper coauthored with Snyder that he mentioned in his 1934 article, “Some
recent contributions to algebraic geometry,” in the Bulletin of the AMS. She then joined
the faculty at Hartwick College in Oneonta, New York, replacing Roxana Vivian as the
professor of mathematics. She remained for seven years, 1931–38, and left after her mar-
riage in the summer of 1938.

On July 14, 1938, Hazel Schoonmaker married Levi Thomas Wilson (1885–1975), who
had a son and a daughter from a previous marriage. The marriage of these two mathe-
maticians was announced in the August 1938 Monthly. L. T. Wilson had graduated from
Washington and Lee University, received a PhD in mathematics from Harvard Univer-
sity in 1915, and in 1917 began his long career at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis,
Maryland.

From 1942 until 1951 Hazel Wilson taught and was chairman of the mathematics de-
partment at Annapolis High School; she studied at Johns Hopkins during the summer of
1945. In 1951 L. T. Wilson retired from the Naval Academy and became professor of math-
ematics and physics and head of the department of physics at Jacksonville State Teachers
College (now Jacksonville State University) in Alabama. At the same time, Hazel Wilson

retired from Annapolis High School and became associate professor of mathematics, also
at Jacksonville State. In 1952 they both also became instructors at the University of Al-
abama, Gadsden Center. In 1956 L. T. Wilson went to Doane College in Crete, Nebraska,
again as professor of mathematics and physics and head of the department. Hazel Wilson
remained at Jacksonville and Gadsden Center for a year until 1957, when she joined her
husband at Doane as professor.

They both remained at Doane until 1959 when they moved to Jacksonville, Florida,
she as professor of mathematics and he as professor of physics and head of the department
of physics and physical sciences at Jacksonville University. They both retired in 1964 as
professors emeriti and later lived in Suncoast Manor, an Episcopal retirement community
in St. Petersburg, Florida. Throughout many of her working years and for a few years
after her retirement, Hazel Schoonmaker Wilson was a frequent contributor of solutions
to the Problems and Solutions section of the American Mathematical Monthly and to the
Problems and Questions section of Mathematics Magazine. In the Monthly her solutions,
or mentions of solutions, averaged about one a year from 1923 to 1968, while those in
Mathematics Magazine averaged two a year from 1954 to 1967.

Wilson was a member of the honor society Phi Kappa Phi and the education honor soci-
ety Pi Lambda Theta in addition to those listed below. She was treasurer of the Maryland
Congress of Parents and Teachers 1939–45. She was an Episcopalian and was treasurer of
the Women’s Auxiliary of Saint Luke’s 1952–56, when they lived in Jacksonville, Alabama.
She was also treasurer 1953–56 of the Faculty Wives Club there. She was a member of the
Order of the Eastern Star and of the Florida Academy of Sciences.

In 1974, nearly ﬁfty years after receiving her PhD, Hazel S. Wilson responded to a
request for a donation to Cornell by honoring her advisor with a signiﬁcant contribution
to the Virgil Snyder Book Endowment. The income from this endowment fund, ﬁnanced
completely by Wilson, allows the mathematics library to purchase several dozen books
every year.

Levi Wilson died in 1975. Hazel Wilson died in Humana Hospital Sunbay in St. Peters-

burg, Florida, at age ninety-nine in 1988.

Organizational aﬃliations: MAA, NCTM, Sigma Delta Epsilon, AAUW, Phi Beta
