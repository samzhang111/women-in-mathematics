MONTAGUE, Harriet F. June 9, 1905–March 19, 1997.
University of Buffalo (BS 1927, MA 1929), Cornell University (PhD 1935).

Harriet Frances Montague, born in Buﬀalo, New York, was the younger of two
children of Alice Barbara (Haﬀa) (1880–1942) and Laurence Hibbard Montague
(1881–1950), both natives of Buﬀalo. Her mother had a high school education and
later was a cashier in retail stores and a homemaker; her father had an elementary
and private musical education and was an organist, choirmaster, and composer. Her
parents married in about 1902; their ﬁrst child, Ainslie B. Montague, was born in
1904 and died in 1921.

Harriet Montague attended Lafayette High School in Buﬀalo before entering
the University of Buﬀalo, where she spent many years as a student, and all of
her career as a faculty member. (The University of Buﬀalo, originally private, was
incorporated into the state system in 1962 and has since been the State University
of New York at Buﬀalo.) Montague received her undergraduate degree from the
University of Buﬀalo magna cum laude in 1927 in the Honors Division. She stayed
at the university as a graduate assistant in mathematics 1927–29 and received her
master’s degree in 1929. She was then appointed instructor in the department and
apparently continued some graduate work in mathematics while also teaching.

In December 1933 Montague applied for admission to Cornell University for the
summer of 1934. She was admitted and studied informally with Virgil Snyder that
summer and continued her formal course work in the academic year 1934–35. It was
recommended that she be given four terms residence credits for her graduate work
at Buﬀalo. A memo of February 1935 indicates that Montague was admitted to
Cornell without ﬁnancial support because she was unknown to any member of the
department. However, reports from her Cornell professors were highly favorable, and
she was recommended for a tuition scholarship for spring 1935. Virgil Snyder, her
dissertation advisor, wrote that he had all the scholars and fellows in the department
in his course and that Miss Montague was as good as any member of the class.
Having completed her dissertation in geometry, Montague received her PhD in
June 1935 with minors in algebra and logic.

After receiving her doctorate, Montague returned to the University of Buﬀalo
and served there as instructor 1929–39, assistant professor 1939–44, associate pro-
fessor 1944–47, and professor 1947–73. She was acting chairman of the mathematics
department during the ﬁrst semester 1945–46 and in the academic years 1962–65,
and was director of undergraduate studies 1970–73. From 1967 she was also profes-
sor of education. She retired as professor emeritus in 1973. In her 1981 Smithsonian
questionnaire she mentioned both Harry M. Gehman, her department head at Buf-
falo 1929–62, and Mabel D. Montgomery, “former student, co-author, friend,” as
close associates with whom she had had signiﬁcant mathematical contact.

Montague contributed to the department and university in many ways. During
the 1930s and 1940s she was often faculty advisor to the University of Buﬀalo mathe-
matics club. Her curriculum vitae from 1976 lists mainly her most recent activities.
She details her departmental committee memberships for 1972–73 as chairman,
Building Committee; chairman, Advisory Committee for Undergraduate Studies;
Mathematics–Education Committee; and Ad Hoc Committee on Course Renum-
bering; she notes that other departmental duties in the past are too numerous to
reconstruct. School and faculty positions included coordinator for the mathematics

section of the Western New York Science Forum, former member of the Executive
Committees of the College of Arts and Sciences and the Millard Fillmore College
(the evening division), and former member of the Student Aﬀairs Committee of the
faculty senate. University activities for 1971–73 included serving as a member of
the President’s Committee on the Recruitment and Promotion of Women Faculty
and Staﬀ and serving as treasurer of the Faculty Club.

Montague taught both undergraduate and graduate courses, primarily in alge-
bra, geometry, and mathematics education and was often faculty advisor to the
mathematics club. She directed one mathematics PhD dissertation, that of Samuel
T. Stern in logic in 1962. She also directed seven dissertations for EdD degrees that
were awarded between 1969 and 1972. Already in 1953 her concern with mathe-
matics education was evident when she organized the Inter-School Math Society
for gifted high school students in six Buﬀalo area schools. According to her 1976
vita, “the selected group of students and their teachers met monthly on a voluntary
basis to study topics in mathematics not in the normal curriculum. This activity
predated the impetus generated by Sputnik to recognize and develop the abilities of
gifted students in science and mathematics” (Smithsonian questionnaire 1981). The
groups met for several years until the National Science Foundation established pro-
grams with similar goals. Montague was director of various NSF summer institutes
for secondary teachers from 1957 until 1970. Her 1963 textbook for non-science stu-
dents, The Signiﬁcance of Mathematics, was coauthored with her colleague Mabel
D. Montgomery, who had received a PhD in mathematics from the University of
Buﬀalo in 1953, the second year such a degree was awarded there.

Montague was active in mathematics and mathematics education organizations.
She was particularly involved with the Upper New York State Section (now the
Seaway Section) of the MAA. She was one of the original founders in 1940, served
as vice chairman 1952–53, chairman 1953–54, and governor 1961–64. In addition,
she served on the MAA nominating committee for 1965 and was a life member of the
association. She was also a member of the International Phenomenological Society
and of Pi Lambda Theta, an honor and professional association in education, and
was a member of the council, and later historian (1974–79), of the Association of
Mathematics Teachers of New York State. She had been a member of the AMS
for sixty-seven years at the time of her death. Montague was active in professional
activities outside of mathematics, especially in Buﬀalo chapters of the AAUP and
the AAUW. She served as secretary and as president of the local branch of the
AAUP and as treasurer of the Buﬀalo AAUW (1937–39). In 1966 the Buﬀalo branch
of the AAUW presented her with its Achievement Award and gave her a lifetime
membership in the organization.

Harriet Montague was an active Presbyterian with an involvement in church
activities at the local, regional, and national levels. In the 1960s she was chairman
of the department of campus ministry for the Council of Churches. She was a ruling
elder of the United Presbyterian Church USA beginning in 1957 and was the ﬁrst
woman to serve as vice-moderator (1963) and moderator (1964) of the Presbytery
of Western New York. She was a member of the Board of Directors of Auburn
Theological Seminary in New York City for several years beginning in 1969, was on
the national Board of Christian Education 1965–72 (vice president 1969–72) of the
United Presbyterian Church USA, and was a member of the National Commission
for United Ministries in Higher Education 1968–72.

In the late 1930s Montague wrote that she was a member of Theta Chi (a social
fraternity) and Cap and Gown, and described herself as a Republican. She men-
tioned music and sports as hobbies. In 1981 she mentioned watercolor painting,
gardening, and volunteer work at the Buﬀalo Zoo, where she was a docent. Non-
professional memberships at that time were the Buﬀalo Zoological Society, where
she was since 1975 on the board of directors; the Buﬀalo Museum of Science; and the
Buﬀalo Historical Society. Other local memberships in 1976 included the YWCA
and the Allentown Association, a neighborhood organization.

In 1972 the State University Alumni Association presented Montague with its
Distinguished Alumni Award. She was given citations at the 50th anniversary of
the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Buﬀalo and at the 125th
anniversary of the founding of the university. The Harriet F. Montague Award was
established at the time of her retirement in 1973. It is presented to an undergraduate
mathematics major after the completion of his or her junior year, and is awarded
on the basis of intellectual and creative promise in mathematics.

After a long illness, Montague died in 1997 at age ninety-one in her Buﬀalo home,
which she shared with Mabel D. Montgomery, her only listed survivor. A memorial
service was held in First Presbyterian Church, Symphony Circle; she is buried in
Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buﬀalo.
