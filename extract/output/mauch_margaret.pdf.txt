MAUCH, Margaret E. June 1, 1897–November 16, 1987.
Huron College (BS 1919), University of Chicago (MS 1923, PhD 1938).

Margaret Evelyn Mauch was born in De Smet, South Dakota, the ﬁrst child of
Rose (Brekhus) (b. 1868) and Henry Mauch (b. 1861). Her mother was born in
Norway and her father in Wisconsin of German parents. Mauch grew up in the
east central area of South Dakota near De Smet. At the time of the 1900 census the
family was living in Lake Preston, her parents had been married four years, and her
father’s occupation was listed as harness maker. A younger sister, Ruby Henrietta,
was born in 1899. By 1910 Henry Mauch, now a banker, had been remarried for three
years, and the family was living in Hetland. In much of the second decade of the
century, Henry Mauch was secretary-treasurer of the Arlington-Hetland Telephone
Company. By 1930 he was bank president. There were two sons from the second
marriage: Ralph, born in 1909, and Harold, born two years later.

Margaret Mauch attended elementary and secondary public schools in South
Dakota. She studied at Huron College (now closed) in Huron, about thirty miles
from De Smet. After receiving her bachelor’s degree in 1919, she taught for a year
at the Winner, South Dakota, high school in the south central part of the state
and then was principal of the Edgerton high school in Minnesota for a year. The
next two years, 1921–23, Mauch attended the University of Chicago where she
was secretary-treasurer of the Junior Mathematical Club 1922–23. She received her
master’s degree with a thesis in theoretical mechanics in 1923.

Mauch taught in the high school in Jacksonville, Florida, 1924–25 and was an
instructor and assistant professor at Randolph-Macon Woman’s College in Lynch-
burg, Virginia, 1925–29. She returned to the University of Chicago to take graduate
courses during the summers of 1926, 1928, and 1929. Following the summer of 1929
she remained at Chicago for the academic year 1929–30. She again took summer
classes at Chicago during 1931 and 1938 and received her PhD in 1938 having writ-
ten a dissertation in number theory under the direction of L. E. Dickson. Although
Mauch’s degree was not conferred until 1938, she had obtained some of her results
on Waring’s theorem for seventh powers considerably earlier. In Dickson’s 1933 ar-
ticle, “Recent Progress on Waring’s Theorem and its Generalizations,” he mentions
her work on page 721 at the end of the section he calls “Remarkable Empirical
Generalizations of Waring’s Theorem.”

Mauch was head of the mathematics department at the high school in Brookings,
South Dakota, 1934–42 and then was an instructor and assistant professor at Car-
leton College in Northﬁeld, Minnesota, 1942–44. She spent 1944–45 as an instructor
at Michigan State College (now Michigan State University). In 1945 Mauch became
assistant professor at the University of Akron, where she was to stay the remainder
of her career. When she ﬁrst went to Akron she regularly attended meetings of
the Ohio Section of the MAA and was a referee for the American Mathematical
Monthly. She was promoted to associate professor in 1950 and to professor in 1962.
She retired in June 1963 but continued teaching at the University of Akron and
was given the rank emeritus professor in 1966.

In 1966 Margaret Mauch and her sister, Ruby Mauch, moved back to Huron,
where they both had attended college and where their younger brother, Ralph, a
graduate of the University of South Dakota Law School, was an attorney and oﬃcer
of the Northwestern Public Service Company. Ruby Mauch had also taught in high

schools in South Dakota after her college graduation, later earned a library degree
from the University of Illinois, and, among other library positions, served for twenty-
seven years in the library at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology; she
retired in 1964. Ralph Mauch died at seventy-ﬁve in 1985. Margaret Mauch died
at the Violet Tschetter Memorial Home in Huron at age ninety in 1987. She was
buried in the Hetland, South Dakota, cemetery. Her sister, Ruby, died at the same
nursing home ﬁve years later.
