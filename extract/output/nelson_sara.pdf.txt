NELSON, Sara L. January 17, 1903–March 6, 1995.
Georgia State College for Women (BS 1926), Cornell University (MS 1930,
PhD 1939).

Sara Louise Nelson was born in Oglethorpe, Georgia, the daughter of Mattie (Trussell)
(1872–1910) and John Pendleton Nelson (1856–1932), both natives of Georgia. It was a
second marriage for her father, who was described as a dry goods merchant in 1900, but
who later was a teacher and then county superintendent of schools for about the last
twenty years of his life. She had one brother, Robert (b. 1898) and at least two older
half-brothers.

Sara Nelson received her elementary and secondary education in the public schools of
Oglethorpe, Georgia. She then attended Georgia State College for Women (now Georgia
College and State University), which had been the two-year Georgia Normal and Industrial
College until shortly before her entrance in the summer of 1922. Nelson continued her
studies there during the regular school year and all summers until June 1926, when she
received her bachelor’s degree with a major in mathematics and a minor in chemistry. A
year earlier she had received a collegiate normal diploma.

For three and a half years Nelson taught mathematics, chemistry, and history in two
high schools in Georgia. She attended the summer session at Cornell University in 1929
and then resumed her studies there in February 1930. She continued in the summer of 1930
and received her master’s degree in September, having studied mathematics and geology
and physical geography.

In fall 1930 Nelson joined the faculty at her alma mater, the Georgia State College
for Women, where she was to spend the rest of her career except for leaves for further
graduate study. She was an instructor for two years before being promoted to assistant
professor.

Nelson again took courses at Cornell during the 1933 summer session and then returned
for full-time study in 1937. She had requested and received some ﬁnancial support from
Georgia State College for Women. The president also reassured her of her position when
she returned. At Cornell she held a tuition scholarship 1937–38 and an Erastus Brooks
fellowship in 1938–39. Although she studied mainly with Virgil Snyder, Snyder retired in
1938, and Robert J. Walker became the chair of her doctoral committee. She received her
doctorate in 1939 with a major in geometry, a ﬁrst minor in algebra, and a second minor
in analysis.

When Nelson returned to Georgia State College for Women in 1939, she was promoted
to associate professor; in 1942 she was promoted to full professor and became department
chair. Nelson was particularly interested in the training of teachers and attended an NSF
summer workshop on that subject in 1963. She remained as department chair until her
retirement in 1968, a year after the school become coeducational and was renamed Georgia
College at Milledgeville. Nelson was also active in the school’s alumni association and
served as its president from 1943 until 1947 and again from 1978 until 1980. In 1987 the
association honored her with The Georgia College Alumni Heritage Award.

Nelson was a member of the Georgia Academy of Science; Phi Kappa Phi, an honor
society for excellence in scholarship; and Pi Gamma Mu, an honor society in the social
sciences. The pastor of the First United Methodist Church of Milledgeville, where she
taught Sunday School for many years, referred to her as “the mother of the Wesley Foun-
dation [Campus Ministry] from its infancy to its maturity” (Funeral meditation by Harold
Lawrence, provided by David J. DeVries).

Sara Nelson died in a local Milledgeville hospital at the age of ninety-two in 1995 and
was buried in the Oglethorpe Cemetery. She was survived by three nieces. The Sara L.
Nelson Fund for Mathematics and Science Education was established at the college.
