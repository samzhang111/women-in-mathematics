ALDEN, Marjorie (Leﬄer). August 29, 1909–October 5, 2000.
Miami University (BA 1930), Ohio State University (MA 1932, PhD 1934).

Marjorie Leﬄer was born in Kyle, Ohio, the eldest of four children of Stella
Eugenia (Durbin) and William Homer Leﬄer. Her parents were both born in Ohio,
in 1882 and 1876, respectively, and married in about 1907. In 1910 the Leﬄers were
living with Marjorie’s maternal grandparents, and William Leﬄer’s occupation was
described as commercial traveler. In 1920 there were four children: Marjorie; two
brothers, Homer (1913–1977) and Norman (1916–1997); and a sister, Ruth (1918–
2006). The family farmed their own land in Butler County, Ohio.

Marjorie Leﬄer received her primary education in the local township school and
her secondary education in the high school of Hamilton, Ohio. In 1930 she graduated
from Miami University in neighboring Oxford, Ohio, magna cum laude, with honors
in mathematics and with general honors. As an undergraduate Leﬄer was involved
in many activities. These included several sports (hockey, soccer, baseball, and
track); classical club; debate; Alethenai, a national literary society; student-faculty
council; disciplinary board; and the year book. She was elected to the honor societies
Phi Beta Kappa, Kappa Delta Pi (education), Tau Kappa Alpha (journalism), and
to Mortar Board.

All of Leﬄer’s graduate work was done at Ohio State University in Columbus.
In 1931 she was awarded a university scholarship in mathematics, which she held
for two years. She earned a master’s degree in 1932; the following year she was
an assistant in the university high school while continuing her work for the PhD.
She also was treasurer of the local chapter of Pi Mu Epsilon that year. Both her
master’s thesis and her doctoral dissertation were in analysis and were directed by
Tibor Rad´o.

After completing her work at Ohio State in 1934, Leﬄer took a position as tutor
and instructor at Mills College in California for 1934–35. On December 20, 1934,
Marjorie Leﬄer married Howard Holston Alden (1908–1998), also of Ohio. He had
received a BS from Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1930 and an MA in 1931 and
a PhD in 1933 in mathematics from Ohio State. In July 1933, he was looking for
jobs; one inquiry was to the president of the University of Saskatchewan in which
he indicated that he was seeking a permanent position in Canada and that he had
had four years of teaching experience at the Carnegie Institute of Technology and
at Ohio State.

Marjorie Leﬄer Alden’s subsequent academic positions were at the same in-
stitutions as her husband’s, but at lower ranks. Howard H. Alden was head of
the mathematics department at New Mexico Military Institute, a junior college in
Roswell, from 1934 to 1943; was associate professor at the University of Wyoming
1945–46; and returned to Ohio State University as assistant professor in 1946. He
was also involved with jet propulsion research during World War II and was a chief
engineer working under Robert H. Goddard 1942–45. During this period, Marjorie
L. Alden was an instructor at New Mexico Military Institute 1936–43, instructor
at the University of Wyoming 1945–46, and instructor at Ohio State starting in
1946. Howard Holston Alden was promoted to associate professor at Ohio State in
1948, while Marjorie Leﬄer Alden remained as instructor. Both resigned from the
university in June 1956, after which it appears they left Columbus.

ALDEN - 2

Marjorie Leﬄer Alden did not publish her thesis or her dissertation. However,
G. E. Albert, a 1938 PhD from the University of Wisconsin who was then at Ohio
State, used a proof that appeared in her master’s thesis in a 1943 paper, “The
closure systems of orthogonal functions,” in the Monthly. This paper appeared
before the Aldens returned to Ohio State.

The Aldens lived for a time in Mesa, Arizona, before moving to California. For
several years in the 1980s and 1990s they lived in a retirement home in La Mesa,
California. Howard Alden died March 1, 1998, at eighty-nine. After an illness of
more than a decade, Marjorie Alden died of cardiorespiratory arrest in Grossmont
Hospital in La Mesa at age ninety-one in 2000. Her ashes were scattered at sea.
Organizational aﬃliations: Phi Beta Kappa, Pi Mu Epsilon.
