McKEE, Ruth (Stauﬀer). July 16, 1910–January 9, 1993.
Swarthmore College (BA 1931), Bryn Mawr College (MA 1933, PhD 1935).

Ruth Caroline Stauﬀer was the second of three children of Hannah (Henry)
(1876–1961) and Charles Christian Stauﬀer (1880–1968), a physician. Both parents
were born in Boyertown, Pennsylvania. Her father received degrees from Franklin
and Marshall College and the Medical School of the University of Pennsylvania. Her
mother earned a certiﬁcate from the Keystone Normal School (later Kutztown State
Teachers College, now Kutztown University of Pennsylvania) and was an elementary
school teacher in a one-room schoolhouse in Boyertown before her marriage in 1905;
after her marriage she worked as the ﬁrst assistant in her husband’s oﬃce. All three
children were born in Harrisburg and received their undergraduate degrees from
Swarthmore. Ruth Stauﬀer’s sister, Martha J. (1909–1991), received an MA from
Columbia, studied at Harvard, and was a mathematics teacher in a high school
and in a community college in Harrisburg. Ruth Stauﬀer’s brother, Charles Henry
(1913–1997), received a master’s degree and a PhD in physical chemistry from
Harvard, and was a chemistry professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, St.
Lawrence University, and Bates College.

Ruth Stauﬀer received her elementary and secondary education in the public
schools of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; she graduated from the all-girls Central High
School at age ﬁfteen in 1926 and did an additional year at the new coeducational
William Penn High School before enrolling at Swarthmore College. She originally
intended to take pre-med courses at Swarthmore. As she said in 1981, “I wanted to
be an MD for a long time, and when I went to college I took pre-med courses, but I
didn’t do too well. . . . In the meantime, math was easy! So I took more math classes
because they were easy. . . . I think that this is maybe important . . . I went to a
girls’ high school; we had excellent math teachers. They were women who went to
places like Wellesley, and they were inspirations” (Smithsonian tapes). She earned
her undergraduate degree at Swarthmore in 1931 with a major in mathematics
and with honors in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Arnold Dresden was her
teacher and advisor there, and she considered him a friend throughout his life.

It was Dresden who urged Stauﬀer to go to Bryn Mawr College and who helped
her obtain the mathematics graduate scholarship there for her ﬁrst year, 1931–32.
She received her master’s degree in 1933 and continued her work at Bryn Mawr
the following year as a scholar of the Society of Pennsylvania Women in New York.
At Bryn Mawr she studied with Anna Pell Wheeler, Emmy Noether, Gustav A.
Hedlund, and Marguerite Lehr. Of Pell Wheeler she later wrote, “She continued to
be interested in me, my family, and my work her entire life, coming to Harrisburg by
train as late as the 1960’s to visit us” (Smithsonian questionnaire 1981). Stauﬀer,
who was Noether’s only doctoral student in the United States, was one of four
women who studied with Noether at Bryn Mawr in 1934–35. The other three, with
postdoctoral scholarships or fellowships, were Marie Weiss, PhD Stanford University
1928; Olga Taussky (Taussky-Todd), PhD Vienna 1930; and Grace Shover (Quinn),
PhD Ohio State University 1931. Accounts of their experiences that year appear in
1983. Emmy Noether, whom Stauﬀer later described as “teacher, PhD Director,
and encouraging friend” (Smithsonian questionnaire), died suddenly in April 1935,
a great blow to Stauﬀer. Her doctoral examination was given by Richard Brauer,
then at the Institute for Advanced Study. After receiving her degree in June 1935

Stauﬀer spent the following year, 1935–36, teaching mathematics at the Bryn Mawr
School in Baltimore and doing postdoctoral work in algebra with Oscar Zariski at
the Johns Hopkins University. She taught mathematics at Miss Fine’s School in
Princeton, New Jersey, 1936–37.

During her last year at Bryn Mawr College, Ruth Stauﬀer met George W. McKee,
then a law student in Philadelphia, and also from Harrisburg. Even though they
were almost neighbors in Harrisburg they had not known one another there. They
married in 1937. George McKee was born in 1908 and graduated from Princeton
in 1931 and from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1934. He had his
own law practice in Harrisburg from 1936 until 1990, although he was semi-retired
from about 1980. He served as a lieutenant in the US Navy during World War II.
During 1938–39, while living in Harrisburg, Ruth McKee taught algebra as an
instructor at Bryn Mawr; however, after becoming pregnant, she was too ill to
continue commuting to Bryn Mawr. Their ﬁrst daughter, Clara, was born in October
1939 and their second, Martha, in December 1941. Clara McKee Rader received a
bachelor’s degree from Bryn Mawr and a master’s degree in English from Yale and
taught English; she is a pastor’s wife and has been active in family and marriage
counseling and in religious education. Martha McKee Keyser received her bachelor’s
degree from Swarthmore and did graduate work in psychology at Temple University
and the University of Pennsylvania. She taught English and now works as a family
therapist.

Ruth McKee wrote in 1981 that “work in mathematics came to a halt when the
girls were born” (Smithsonian questionnaire). In 1953, about a dozen years after
her youngest daughter was born, McKee began her employment with the Joint
State Government Commission in Harrisburg. As an analyst she did mathematical
statistics for this non-partisan research agency for the Pennsylvania state legislature
until her retirement in 1980. She planned and directed analyses and reports of the
commission in areas such as eﬃciency of Pennsylvania state mental hospitals, traﬃc
safety laws, costs of state owned and related colleges and universities, equalization of
public school subsidies, and retirement costs as related to proposed liberalization of
beneﬁts. In her 1981 questionnaire McKee credited Noether’s “methods of working
and thinking” as greatly inﬂuencing her “approach to problem solving at the Joint
State Government Commission.”

Ruth McKee’s non-mathematical interests included story telling (she was a mem-
ber of the National League of Story Tellers), sketching and oil painting, weaving,
bird watching, the Girl Scouts (she was a leader), and teaching in Sunday School
of the United Church of Christ. She was involved with parent education groups
through various local civic clubs in Harrisburg. In the mid-1960s the McKees win-
terized, and moved to, Ruth McKee’s parents’ former summer home in Dauphin,
just northwest of Harrisburg.

In 1980 George and Ruth McKee moved to Pennswood Village, a retirement
community in Newtown, Pennsylvania. While there they were both active in vol-
unteer work, he as a president of the Pennswood Village’s resident association and
she as a contributor to budgeting and planning for the association. They had many
friends there and made trips to Princeton for art shows and lectures. Ruth McKee
also resumed her interest in art and was able for the ﬁrst time to work in three
dimensions and develop her abilities in sculpture. Also, in her retirement she be-
came active in the Society of Friends. Ruth McKee’s older daughter said in a phone

conversation with one of the authors that she had an amazing combination of gifts
and “made a huge impression on all of us. She had friends of all ages.” Ruth McKee
died at Pennswood Village at age eighty-two in 1993. George McKee died there just
over two years later.
