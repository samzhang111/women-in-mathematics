BROWN, Eleanor (Pairman). June 8, 1896–September 14, 1973.
University of Edinburgh (MA 1917), Radcliffe College (PhD 1922).

Eleanor Pairman was born in Broomieknowe, Lasswade, in the parish of Cockpen,
Midlothian, Scotland, the youngest of four daughters of Helen (Dunlop) (b. ca.
1858) and John Pairman (b. ca. 1854), solicitor, Supreme Courts of Scotland. Her
parents married in Edinburgh on July 1, 1886. Her father died when she was quite
young, apparently before 1901, leaving her mother with few resources to raise her
family. Eleanor’s sisters were Maxwell (Maxie) (b. ca. 1888), Margaret (Madge)
(b. ca. 1890), and Adeline (Aline) (b. ca. 1891); they did not marry. According to
information supplied by John Pairman Brown, Eleanor’s eldest son, Maxie taught
at a boarding school in England; Madge was proprietor of a tea shop, “The Ancient
Grudge,” northeast of Edinburgh; and Aline did some baby minding and kept the
Pairman family home in Broomieknowe. Eleanor was known as Nora by her family.
Nora Pairman attended Lasswade Higher Grade School 1903–08 and George
Watson’s Ladies’ College 1908–14 before enrolling in the University of Edinburgh.
Three years later, in 1917, she received her MA with ﬁrst class honours in math-
ematics and natural philosophy. At that time the master’s degree was the ﬁrst
degree given in universities in Scotland. The year she received her master’s degree,
she was awarded the Vans Dunlop scholarship in mathematics, a three-year schol-
arship, awarded by competitive examination, which could be used for study at any
university. It was awarded for “ ‘distinguished proﬁciency’ in the various subjects
of competition as determined by the Examiners and the Senatus Academicus” (Ed-
inburgh University Calendar 1917–1918, 269). Pairman continued her studies as a
graduate student in mathematics at the University of Edinburgh 1917–18.

Eleanor Pairman read two papers at meetings of the Edinburgh Mathematical
Society early in 1918. On February 4, 1918, Cargill G. Knott, then president of
the society and one of Pairman’s instructors at Edinburgh, wrote a letter of rec-
ommendation to the dean of Radcliﬀe College in Massachusetts. He indicated that
Pairman intended to continue her studies at Radcliﬀe. He wrote:

Throughout her career as an undergraduate Miss Pairman’s ex-
ceptional mathematical abilities were in strong evidence. Although
her natural inclinations were towards Pure Mathematics, she easily
mastered the Principles and Methods of Applied Mathematics, and
gained the Medal in both my Honours Classes in Dynamics and Hy-
drodynamics, and this among a group of students of marked ability.
Miss Pairman also attended a short course I give on Hamiltonian
Quaternions with Physical Applications, and there I was impressed
with her capacity for appreciating the theoretical foundations of
the calculus.

Very rarely indeed have we had the good fortune of teaching
a student with such a strong predilection for mathematical study
as Miss Pairman undoubtedly possesses. With ﬁtting opportunity
she has every promise of a distinguished and useful career. (Letter
provided to author by John Pairman Brown)

During 1918–19 Pairman was a graduate student in applied statistics at the Uni-
versity of London and joined the staﬀ of Karl Pearson’s laboratory in the Depart-
ment of Applied Statistics at University College London. In 1919 they published an

article in Biometrika, a journal that Pearson edited. In the same issue in which their
article appeared, Pearson published an editorial, “Peccavimus! [We have sinned!],”
in which he corrected a previous article and noted, “As the problem is an exceed-
ingly important one the writer asked Miss Eleanor Pairman to revise his work. . . .
This she has done with certain additions and expansions” (12:267). Also in 1919,
Pairman produced the ﬁrst volume of tables in the Tracts for Computers series
edited by Pearson.

At about the same time, Karl Pearson wrote to the United States consul in Lon-
don indicating that Pairman had been granted a scholarship at Radcliﬀe College,
noting that he had done what he could to obtain a passport for her, and requesting
that she be admitted to the United States. Eleanor Pairman arrived in New York
from London on October 12, 1919, to begin her studies at Radcliﬀe College. She
ﬁnished her dissertation in analysis under the direction of G. D. Birkhoﬀ in the
fall of 1921 and received her doctorate from Radcliﬀe College in 1922. She was the
third of nine women to receive a doctorate in mathematics from Radcliﬀe before
1940.

On August 10, 1922, Eleanor Pairman and Bancroft Huntington Brown, a fellow
graduate student, were married at Roselea, the Pairman home in Broomieknowe,
Scotland. B. H. Brown was born on November 11, 1894, in Hyde Park, Mas-
sachusetts, and received a bachelor’s degree in 1916 and a master’s degree in 1917
from Brown University. B. H. Brown served in the US Army 1917–19; an article
by Fenster, Kent, and Archibald notes that he was discharged in order to teach at
Harvard University, where mathematics instructors were urgently needed. He served
as instructor 1919–21 and continued his graduate work in mathematics there. He
received his doctorate in June 1922, the same time as Eleanor Pairman.

After receiving their doctorates, Bancroft and Nora Brown moved to Hanover,
New Hampshire, where B. H. Brown joined the faculty of Dartmouth College, then
a men’s school with an all-male faculty that had occasionally admitted women as
graduate students. He remained at Dartmouth his entire career; he was an instructor
1922–24, assistant professor 1924–31, professor 1931–46, and B. P. Cheney professor
until his retirement in 1962. He was director of the Navy V-12 mathematics training
program at Dartmouth 1943–45.

The Browns had four children: John Pairman (1923–2010), Barbara (1925–1979),
Joanna (1935–1935), and Margaret Wylde (b. 1937). Soon after her ﬁrst two chil-
dren were born, Eleanor P. Brown published a paper with Rudolph E. Langer that
had originated in Brown’s dissertation. Langer was another 1922 Birkhoﬀ student
who had also come to Dartmouth in 1922, and who remained on the faculty there
until 1925.

John Pairman Brown, the eldest child, majored in mathematics and classics at
Dartmouth, was in the US Army Air Corps, was a junior fellow at Harvard, and
later earned a doctorate from Union Theological Seminary. His positions included
ones at American University of Beirut, the Ecumenical Peace Institute in San Fran-
cisco, the Northern California Ecumenical Council, and the Graduate Theological
Union, among others. He served as a representative to peace events at various places
throughout the world and published extensively, mainly in classics and on New and
Old Testament themes. Barbara Brown graduated from Vassar in three years after
majoring in English and classics. She earned both a master’s degree and a PhD in
language and literature from Rutgers University and was a lecturer in English at

the Rutgers Newark campus for several years before her death at ﬁfty-four. Mar-
garet Brown studied at Brown University and became a medical editor and medical
transcriptionist. All of the children married and had families.

Most summers the Brown family went to Martha’s Vineyard, where B. H. Brown’s
parents had a small cottage. His parents also spent about four months a year with
the Browns in Hanover. Otherwise, there was little traveling; neither Nora nor B.
H. Brown drove an automobile or traveled by air. However, Nora Brown did take
John and Barbara, the two older children, to Scotland for visits twice when they
were young, once in summer 1929 and again in summer 1934; and in March of 1936,
she and Barbara made a trip to Bermuda. Also, often in the spring she took a train
to Boston to see the ﬂower show and stayed overnight.

It appears that Nora Brown began to learn Braille in about the late 1940s or
early 1950s. Her daughter Margaret recalled that after learning regular Braille, she
then learned the Nemeth Code for mathematical notation. In a letter to one of the
authors, Margaret wrote, “Geometry was a particular problem, because you really
need diagrams. Braille is done on paper like thin cardstock. So she rounded up
all kinds of household implements like pinking shears and pastry wheels and such
and created diagrams that could be felt with the ﬁngers, like the Braille symbols.
Apparently nobody had ever done this before.” Nora Brown’s son-in-law Thomas
Streeter recalled a visit to Hanover in which he was shown some of her work. “A
graduate student at Harvard was blind and needed a particular book put into
Braille, and it was full of mathematical symbols. What to do? The sewing machine,
of course. She had written down the math and had it beside the machine. She put
a piece of Braille paper under the foot and proceeded to reproduce the symbols
by guiding the paper under the needle. It had to be the mirror image of what
she had written.” An article in the Hanover Gazette, probably published in 1959,
indicated that she had just returned from attending the Third Annual Conference
of the National Braille Club in New York, where mathematical workshops were
directed by Abraham Nemeth. The article indicated that she was transcribing two
mathematical texts, one for a freshman at Boston College and one a reference book
on group theory for a post-graduate course at Columbia University. The article also
noted that in addition to her work with Braille, she was holding conferences with
Dartmouth freshmen three hours a week, and that she had taken over a course at
the end of spring term.

Her daughter Margaret also wrote: “For all the satisfaction that she got from
these [Braille] projects, the only time I saw her truly happy was when she was
teaching. And she had precious little opportunity to do that, being obviously ahead
of her time and also stuck in a males-only college community and in a world where
it was well-nigh impossible for married ladies to function professionally.” Eleanor
P. Brown was, however, a part-time instructor of mathematics at Dartmouth from
September 1955 until June 1959.

After a lengthy illness, Eleanor P. Brown developed metastatic breast cancer
and was in a nursing home in nearby White River Junction, Vermont, until her
death there at age seventy-seven in 1973. She was survived by her husband, two
sisters, three children, seven grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter. Bancroft
H. Brown died on May 7 the following year.
