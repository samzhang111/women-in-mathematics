CALKINS, Helen. October 20, 1893–June 17, 1970.
Knox College (BA 1916), Columbia University (MA 1921), Cornell University
(PhD 1932).

Helen Calkins was born in Quincy, Illinois, the ﬁrst of two daughters of Anna
Burns (Schermerhorn) (b. 1869) and Addison Niles Calkins (b. 1865), both of Illi-
nois. Her parents married in October 1892. By 1900 her father was superintendent
of Electric Wheelworks in Quincy. Her younger sister, Ruth Calkins, was born in
1901 and later attended a business college in Quincy.

Helen Calkins attended Quincy High School 1908–12 and Knox College in Gales-
burg, Illinois, 1912–16. The year after her 1916 college graduation with special
honor in mathematics, she taught mathematics in junior high school in Quincy; the
following year she taught mathematics in the senior high school in Jacksonville, Illi-
nois. She then returned to Knox College, where she was instructor in mathematics
1918–20.

Calkins began her graduate work in mathematics as a university scholar at
Columbia University in 1920–21. While there she studied history of mathematics
and the teaching of mathematics with David Eugene Smith, fundamental concepts
with Edward Kasner, and diﬀerential equations with W. B. Fite. She received her
master’s degree at the end of that academic year.

Calkins returned to Knox College as instructor in 1921. She was promoted to
assistant professor in 1922 but took a leave of absence from Knox in 1923 to return
to Columbia. While at Knox she developed a course in the history of mathematics
inspired by her earlier work at Columbia with Smith. She again held a scholarship at
Columbia in 1923–24, when she studied Einstein’s theory, inﬁnite series, diﬀerential
equations, modern geometry, and the philosophy of mathematics. She continued her
leave from Knox in 1924–25, when she traveled in the United States and Cuba. She
attended Columbia part time during 1925–26 and traveled in Europe in the summer
and fall of 1926.

In July 1926, in information submitted to the appointments bureau at Columbia,
Calkins indicated that she would prefer to be near a good library, that she was a
Presbyterian, and that she read and spoke German and Spanish. Calkins served
as instructor at the University of Nebraska, substituting for someone on leave of
absence, during the second semester 1926–27. By the summer of 1927 she had
completed residency requirements for the PhD degree at Columbia.

Calkins was hired at Sweet Briar College for the year 1927–28 as professor of
mathematics and acting head of the mathematics department, while Eugenie M.
Morenus was on leave in England. Julia Wells Bower also joined the mathematics
faculty at Sweet Briar in 1927 and remained the next three years until she left
to start her doctoral work at the University of Chicago. Calkins earned a salary of
$2800 for the year and paid the college $450 to cover the cost of her room, board and
laundry at the college for the academic year. She lived in Professor Morenus’s room,
which was described by the president of Sweet Briar in a letter of June 27, 1927, as
“a very attractive front room in one of the faculty houses, in which the dining-room
is situated where about eighteen members of the faculty have their meals” (Faculty
Files, Sweet Briar College Archives). There were also arrangements for her small
coupe.

On Janurary 17, 1930, the president of Sweet Briar summarized the quality of
Calkins’ work to a Chicago teacher’s agency. “We were so much impressed with Miss
Calkins’ ability that it was with deep regret that we allowed her to leave. There
is a lucidity of mind, an ability to present any matter with which she is dealing,
a gentleness and charm of personality, and an all-round sanity that will go far in
academic usefulness” (Faculty Files, Sweet Briar College Archives).

In the summer of 1928 Calkins enrolled at Cornell and took classes through the
summer of 1930 as a scholarship holder. Her intended advisor, Charles F. Roos,
left Cornell for the AAAS in 1930, at the same time that Calkins took a job as
professor and acting head of the department of Pennsylvania College for Women in
Pittsburgh. In May 1931 Roos was asked to stay on as her advisor, and he agreed to
do so as long as someone else at Cornell assumed joint responsibility with him. On
May 20, 1931, he wrote to F. K. Richtmyer, the dean of the graduate school, that
Calkins was “working on a problem of maximizing a functional not of the ordinary
calculus of variations type” and suggested David Clinton Gillespie as the person to
be the oﬃcial advisor since Calkins had taken a course in calculus of variations from
him (Box 69 C-1-C-5-C, Graduate School Records, Division of Rare and Manuscript
Collections, Cornell University Library). Roos then described some aspects of her
progress and wrote, “I think that Miss Calkins’ thesis is of unusual interest.” In
her dissertation, which was approved in October 1931, she acknowledges both Roos
and Wallie Abraham Hurwitz, whom she later listed as a personal friend; the degree
was awarded in February 1932.

Except for brief periods, Calkins spent the remainder of her career as professor
and head of the department at Pennsylvania College for Women, where she was
usually the only member of the mathematics department. It appears that upon her
arrival she initiated a student mathematics club known as Beta Chi, which existed
during most of her ﬁrst decade there. She served on a number of standing faculty
committees, especially those on the curriculum and the library. She also served on
the advisory board. During the summer of 1941, Calkins worked as a statistician
in engineering defense training at Pennsylvania State College. She spent 1943–44
at the University of Minnesota, where she taught mathematics to pre-ﬂight cadets.
During the 1930s and 1940s Calkins consistently attended meetings of the Allegheny
Section of the MAA. After having been on leave the year 1956–57, Calkins retired as
professor emeritus in 1957, two years after the school changed its name to Chatham
College (now University).

Calkins was a member of Delta Delta Delta social sorority; Pi Lambda Theta,
an education honor and professional association; the College Club of Pittsburgh;
and the Daughters of the American Revolution. After her retirement, she moved
back to Quincy, Illinois, where she was a member of the Quincy country club and
the First United Presbyterian Church.

Helen Calkins died at age seventy-six in 1970 of arteriosclerotic heart disease
at the Good Samaritan Home in Quincy, Illinois, where she had resided for about
four years. She was survived by her sister and was entombed in the Woodland
Mausoleum in Quincy.
