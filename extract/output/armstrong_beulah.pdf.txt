ARMSTRONG, Beulah. November 18, 1895–February 22, 1965.
Baker University (BA 1917), University of Kansas (MA 1918), University of
Illinois (PhD 1921).

Beulah May Armstrong was born in Sterling, Kansas, the only daughter and the
third of ﬁve children of Lillie J. (Detter), born in 1872, and John Allen Armstrong,
born in 1867, both natives of Pennsylvania. Her parents married in about 1888. Her
brothers were all born in Kansas: Guy W. in 1889, Russell B. in 1894, John A. in
1897, and William Keith in about 1905. In 1900 the family was living in Enterprise
Township, Kansas, where her father was a farmer; in 1910 they were in Hutchinson,
Kansas, and her father owned or managed a hardware store. The family remained
in Hutchinson, and no occupation was listed for her father in later census reports.
Armstrong graduated from Hutchinson High School before entering Baker Uni-
versity, a coeducational school aﬃliated with the Methodist Church, in Baldwin
City in eastern Kansas. While at Baker she became a member of the social sorority
Zeta Tau Alpha. After her graduation from Baker University in 1917, Armstrong
held a scholarship for a year at the nearby University of Kansas. She received her
master’s degree in 1918 and was awarded a fellowship at Kansas for the following
year but resigned it, apparently to continue her graduate work at the University of
Illinois with a scholarship in 1918–19 and a fellowship in 1919–21. She received her
PhD in 1921 from Illinois with a dissertation in group theory.

Armstrong remained at Illinois as instructor 1921–31, associate 1931–45, assis-
tant professor 1945–59, and associate professor from 1959 until her retirement in
1963 as associate professor emeritus. A former colleague, P. W. Ketchum, recalled
that, “as a teacher she was tops.” She was heavily involved with advising stu-
dents who were planning to become mathematics teachers and taught many of the
courses they were to take. She also was an instructor in the University of Illinois
correspondence course program.

Armstrong was active in a number of organizations on and oﬀ campus. She
was a charter member of the University of Illinois chapter of Sigma Delta Epsilon,
graduate fraternity for women in science; she remained active at the local level and
was honored for her contributions at the time of her retirement. She also served as
national treasurer in 1946 and 1947. She served as secretary and treasurer of the
Illinois chapter of Sigma Xi and was a member of Kappa Delta Pi, an education
honor society. While at the University of Illinois, she continued her interest in her
college social sorority, Zeta Tau Alpha, and was honored by them in 1964 for her
service to the Illinois chapter and the Champaign-Urbana alumnae association. She
had held advisory and corporate board positions for the chapter and oﬃces in the
alumnae association. After her death a memorial study in the chapter house at
Illinois was established in her name.

Armstrong was described by P. W. Ketchum as athletic, and he related that she
and his wife, Gertrude Stith Ketchum, played volleyball. In 1937 Beulah Armstrong
indicated that she was especially interested in reading, philanthropy, and traveling.
For her entry in Who’s Who of American Women in the late 1950s, she identiﬁed as
a Republican and a Methodist. She was a member of Wesley Methodist Church in
Urbana, was active in the work of the Wesley Foundation, and in 1923 served as na-
tional president of Kappa Phi, a non-denominational group for Christian university
women.

Shortly after her retirement, Armstrong indicated that she was expecting to
move to a retirement community in Boulder, Colorado, in about a year and a half.
However, she died suddenly of a coronary occlusion at age sixty-nine at her home in
Urbana, Illinois, in 1965. She was survived by three brothers, Guy W. Armstrong,
R. B. Armstrong, and W. Keith Armstrong. She was buried in Fairlawn Cemetery,
Hutchinson, Kansas. Her estate included a bequest of $1,000 to Baker University.
