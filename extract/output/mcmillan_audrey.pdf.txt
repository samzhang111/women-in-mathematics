McMILLAN, Audrey (Wishard). July 7, 1914–January 10, 2008.
Northwestern University (BS 1935), Radcliffe College (MA 1936, PhD 1938).

Elizabeth Audrey Wishard was born in Jubbulpore (now Jabalpur), India, the
only child of Lena (Linn) (1887–1973), born in Sumner, Iowa, and Glenn Porter
Wishard (1883–1956), of Clinton, Indiana. Her parents both received bachelor’s de-
grees from Northwestern University in 1907 and married in July 1908. Her father
was YMCA secretary, foreign service, and served in Jubbulpore 1910–15; Banga-
lore, India, 1919–22; Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), 1923–33; and Manila, (US)
Commonwealth of the Philippines (now Republic of the Philippines), 1936–45. Be-
tween his two India postings he apparently attended the University of Chicago and
received a master’s degree in about 1919. Audrey Wishard ﬁrst attended the Ko-
dai School (now the Kodaikanal International School), a boarding school founded
primarily for the education of children of American missionaries, in southern India.
In 1927 she and her mother moved to Pasadena, California, where she continued
her schooling. Her parents were divorced in 1932.

Audrey Wishard attended Pasadena Junior College in California 1929–31 before
entering Northwestern University, from which she graduated in 1935. It was noted
in her obituary that at Northwestern she studied “as much mathematics as possible,
and then as much painting as there was time for,” and that she worked as a waitress
in an adult YMCA camp in Wisconsin in the summers. She studied at Radcliﬀe
College the next three years and earned a master’s degree in 1936 and a doctorate in
1938 with a dissertation in analysis directed by Lars V. Ahlfors. She was a graduate
student assistant her last two years at Radcliﬀe.

The next four years, 1938–42, Audrey Wishard was an instructor at Vassar Col-
lege. Presumably she replaced Marie Weiss who had moved back to Sophie New-
comb College in 1938. While at Vassar, Wishard taught trigonometry and analysis,
diﬀerential calculus, projective geometry, and solid geometry. When Wishard left
Vassar, Frances Baker, who had been at Mount Holyoke the previous seven years,
joined the Vassar faculty as associate professor.

In June 1942 Wishard moved to Princeton, New Jersey, where she was to become
a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in the fall. In Princeton she was
introduced to Brockway McMillan and on September 2, 1942, they were married.
Brockway McMillan was born on March 30, 1915, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He
attended Armour Institute of Technology (now Illinois Institute of Technology) in
Chicago 1932–34 and received a bachelor’s degree in 1936 and a PhD in 1939 from
MIT. He was a Proctor fellow, Fine instructor, and research associate at Princeton
University 1939–42.

In 1942–43 Audrey McMillan was a member of the School of Mathematics and
an assistant to Hermann Weyl at the Institute for Advanced Study. Starting in
1942 her mother worked as a clerk at the Educational Testing Service, also in
Princeton, and remained in that position until 1960. Brockway McMillan became
an ensign in the US Naval Reserve after completing oﬃcer training school and was
later a lieutenant. They were both in Dahlgren, Virginia, starting in early summer
1943, and Audrey McMillan worked for the Bureau of Ordnance as an associate
in mathematics at the US Naval Proving Ground there. The McMillans remained
in Dahlgren through 1945, when, at the end of December, he was ordered to Los
Alamos in New Mexico.

In 1946 Brockway McMillan began a long association with Bell Telephone Labo-
ratories, where he worked most of the next thirty years. From 1946 to 1961, he was
at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, as research mathematician 1946–55, assistant director
of systems engineering 1955–59, and director of military research 1959–61. From
1961 to 1965 he was with the US Air Force in Washington, D.C., as assistant secre-
tary for research and development 1961–63 and as under secretary 1963–65. In 1965
he returned to Bell Labs in Whippany, New Jersey, where he was executive director
for military research 1965–69 and vice president for military systems 1969–79. He
was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1969.

The McMillans had three children during the 1940s and early 1950s. Sarah Linn
was born in 1946 in Los Alamos, New Mexico; Douglas Wishard was born in 1947
in Summit, New Jersey; and Gordon Brockway was born in 1952 in Boston, Mas-
sachusetts. Sarah earned a BA degree from Radcliﬀe in 1968 and a PhD degree from
Yale in 1979 in Far Eastern languages and literature; she has worked primarily as
a computer scientist in computational linguistics. Douglas received a bachelor’s de-
gree from Harvard in 1969, a master’s degree in architecture from the University
of California, Berkeley, in 1976, and an MBA from the Wharton School, University
of Pennsylvania, in 1983. He was vice president of a bank for several years and
later went into business for himself. Gordon received a bachelor’s degree from the
University of California, Berkeley, in 1980 and has worked mainly as a computer
programmer and computer software consultant.

Audrey McMillan wrote in 1997, “I do not think it possible to care for 3 small
children and do mathematical research. I tried. Unfortunately, I did not realize that,
at age 50, I might have been able to” (authors’ questionnaire). Instead, she turned
her attention to elementary school teaching and consulting, which interested her
because of the “new math.” When they were living in Washington, D.C., in 1961–
65, she was an instructor at the Georgetown Day School. In the summer of 1967,
she taught a course in “new math” for elementary school teachers at New York
University, where she developed teaching materials for early primary students. She
was a consultant to the Summit, New Jersey, board of education 1966–76 and led
seminars in local schools.

McMillan was a Democrat since 1936, and she was a Unitarian 1948–1970. Her
hobbies were painting (realistic oils and watercolors) and music (listening, piano,
and choral singing). In 1980, shortly after their retirement, the McMillans moved
from Summit, New Jersey, to Sedgwick, Maine, a small town midway up the Maine
coast where they had summered since 1967. From 1982 to 1986 Audrey McMillan
was active in the Four Town Nursing Service, which she served as treasurer 1984–86.
For ﬁfteen years, 1981–96, she was a member of the Sargentville Thursday Club, of
which she was treasurer for about ﬁve years. Brockway and Audrey McMillan both
served on the board of overseers for the Kneisel Hall Chamber Music Festival in
nearby Blue Hill, Maine. After retiring, the McMillans traveled to Greece, France,
Britain, and Alaska. Audrey McMillan died at her home in Sedgwick, Maine, in Jan-
uary 2008, after an illness of just over a year. She was ninety-three. She was survived
by her husband, three children, seven grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
