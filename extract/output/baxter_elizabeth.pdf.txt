BAXTER, Elizabeth (Pillsbury). June 8, 1906–April 14, 1966.
Bryn Mawr College (BA 1927), University of Michigan (MA 1935, PhD 1939).

Margaret Elizabeth Pillsbury was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the elder of two
children of Margaret May (Milbank) (1880–1972), born in New York, and Walter
Bowers Pillsbury (1872–1960), born in Iowa. Her mother earned a BA degree from
the University of Michigan in 1905, and her parents married in June of that year.
Her father, who had received a BA from the University of Nebraska in 1892 and
a PhD from Cornell in 1896, was appointed to the department of philosophy and
psychology at the University of Michigan in 1897. He became the chairman of
the psychology department when the disciplines were separated in the 1920s and
remained on the faculty at Michigan until his retirement in 1942. His interests lay
primarily in reasoning and attention; he was starred in the ﬁfth edition of American
Men of Science and was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. A son,
Walter Milbank, was born in 1919 in Ann Arbor, held an MBA from Harvard
University, was a management oﬃcer with the US Department of the Army, and
died in 1969 in Washington, D.C.

After Elizabeth Pillsbury’s graduation from Ann Arbor High School, she entered
Bryn Mawr College. While there she held a James E. Rhoads junior scholarship and
three scholarships her senior year: the Charles S. Hinchman memorial scholarship,
the Elizabeth S. Shippen scholarship in science, and the Elizabeth Wilson White
memorial scholarship. Pillsbury graduated summa cum laude in mathematics and
chemistry in 1927.

Elizabeth Pillsbury ﬁrst enrolled at the University of Michigan in the summer
of 1927. She also studied at G¨ottingen in 1927 and in Berlin in 1928. From 1928
to 1932 she was a graduate student in chemistry at the University of California
in Berkeley. Also during this period she married, in 1930, Warren Phelps Baxter,
born in Montreal in 1901, a chemist who had received a PhD from the California
Institute of Technology in 1928. In 1930 he was a chemist for Shell Development, the
research division of Shell Oil Company, in Emeryville, near Berkeley, California. In
1949, while employed by National Technical Laboratories in South Pasadena, he and
a colleague patented a glass electrode to measure pH in highly alkaline solutions.
Elizabeth and Warren Baxter had a daughter, Margaret Elizabeth, in 1934, and a
son, John Walter, in 1939.

In summer 1935 Baxter enrolled as a candidate for a master’s degree in math-
ematics at the University of Michigan. Since she was given credit for some of her
work at California, she received the master’s degree from Michigan in 1935. She con-
tinued her work there in the academic year 1935–36, the summers of 1936 and 1937,
and part time in the second semester of 1937–38. She completed her dissertation in
1938 and received the PhD from Michigan in February 1939.

From 1945 to 1947 Elizabeth Baxter worked as a research analyst for the Douglas
Aircraft Company. In 1947 she was hired by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the
California Institute of Technology. The following year she registered for a three-day
symposium on modern calculating machinery and numerical methods that provided
the participants information about then current ultra-high-speed numerical calcu-
lation. Baxter was a theoretical analyst 1947–50 and a research engineer after 1950,
working mainly in the area of numerical analysis.
