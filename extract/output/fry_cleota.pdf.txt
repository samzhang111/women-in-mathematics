FRY, Cleota G. December 30, 1910–July 1, 2001.
Reed College (BA 1933), Purdue University (MS 1936, PhD 1939).

Cleota Gage Fry was born in Shoshone, Idaho, the eldest of four children of
Coral (Gage) (1891–1959), born in Mitchell, South Dakota, and Holmes L. Fry
(1878–1968), originally of Davenport, Iowa. Her parents were married on January
12, 1910. Her mother, with a grade school education, was a housewife; her father,
who had completed high school, was a machinist. Her younger siblings were Gladys
Viola (1912–1977), born in Dietrich, Idaho; Russell (1919–1944), born in Portland,
Oregon, and killed in action in World War II, having completed one semester of
college before entering the service; and Eathel Irene (1921–1993), also born in Port-
land. Both sisters were educated through high school and married.

Fry’s early, secondary, and undergraduate schooling was in Portland, where she
graduated from Roosevelt High School in 1929. She then attended Reed College,
having borrowed money from a lawyer friend, and graduated, probably as a physics
major, in 1933. Her undergraduate thesis in the Division of Mathematics and Nat-
ural Sciences was “Analysis of textile ﬁbers and fabrics.”

An undated letter from Fry to her Reed College physics professor, A. A. Knowl-
ton, sent sometime in 1955 summarizes her activities after her graduation from
Reed.

Late in October [1933], I climbed aboard a U[nion] P[aciﬁc] train
headed east and got oﬀ in Chicago. Vivian [Johnson, a Reed College
friend] met me, and we took in the World’s Fair. I came down to
Lafayette, Indiana. Since I could live with Vivian I started sitting
in on graduate courses in mathematics and physics. In February I
secured a part time job helping Dr. R. B. Abbott on his research
on violins. I registered for 10 hours of course work and thereby
launched my graduate study. I continued helping on the research
program to ﬁnd out what makes a violin good. To earn a little
more money, I also tutored.

I wrote a master’s thesis on atomic form factors under Dr. Nord-
heim. The M.S. degree was granted in February 1936. There being
nothing else to do, I started to work on a Ph.D. I changed from
physics to mathematics as a major in the fall of 1937 because my
thesis problem fell through since most of the work was published
[the] previous summer. (letter in author’s possession courtesy of

In 1939 Fry received her doctorate in mathematics with a minor in physics, having
written a dissertation in analysis under the direction of H. K. Hughes. Her PhD
was the second in mathematics given by Purdue, the ﬁrst having been awarded in
1893.

Fry remained at Purdue for her entire career, teaching at various times both
mathematics and physics. She was an assistant instructor of mathematics 1939–40
and an instructor of physics 1941–45. During the war years she taught elementary
and intermediate physics and was in charge of the physics laboratory. She also
organized intensive physics courses for high school students.

The rest of her career at Purdue she was in the mathematics department: as in-
structor 1945–47, assistant professor 1947–55, and associate professor 1955–77. Her

teaching consisted of mathematics courses from the freshman through the gradu-
ate level. In the late 1940s, she was appointed faculty advisor to the mathematics
majors. In the period 1952–61 she was also assistant to the dean in the School of
Science. Fry coauthored a college mathematics textbook in 1952. In the mid-1950s
she taught in a summer program for high school teachers set up by the General
Electric Company. She also helped with Purdue’s sci-math assembly, where high
school students contribute projects and short papers, and with Purdue’s spring
regional Science Fair. She served on university and departmental committees and
was secretary to the faculty of the School of Science, Education, and Humanities
for at least three years in the early 1950s. She also served on examining committees
for master’s degree candidates, and preliminary and ﬁnal examinations for PhD
candidates.

In Fry’s 1955 letter to Knowlton she wrote, “Vivian has told you about our house
which we built together and the trips we take every summer. We occasionally knock
a golf ball around Purdue’s two courses. The scores are astronomical. The rest of
the time we get our exercise by yard work.” She also wrote, “The academic life and
work seems to agree with me. Anyway I like it.” Vivian A. Johnson was a member
of the physics department at Purdue; she retired in 1979 and died in 1985. Their
trips included a seven-month trip around the world.

Fry’s next-door neighbor described Fry as not even ﬁve feet tall, with curly hair
and delicate features, a “raving beauty.” She said Fry was sweet, happy, and laughed
a lot.

Cleota Fry died at ninety in 2001 in the St. Elizabeth Medical Center in Lafayette,
Indiana. She had had a heart attack a few days earlier and chose not to have open
heart surgery. There is a Cleota Gage Fry scholarship, a need-based scholarship at
Reed College, as the result of an annuity purchased by Fry.
