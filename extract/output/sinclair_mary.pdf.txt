SINCLAIR, Mary E. September 27, 1878–June 3, 1955.
Oberlin College (BA 1900), University of Chicago (MA 1903, PhD 1908).

Mary Emily Sinclair was the fourth of ﬁve children of Marietta S. (Fletcher)
(1840–1913), a native of Worcester, Massachusetts, and John Elbridge Sinclair
(1838–1915), who was born in New Hampshire. Her parents met when, in 1869, they
received the two new faculty appointments at the Worcester County Free Institute
of Industrial Science (Worcester Polytechnic Institute after 1887) in Massachusetts,
then a men’s institution. The school had opened the previous year. Her mother,
who had studied in France and Germany, was hired to teach English and modern
languages. Her father, recently widowed and the father of two young daughters,
arrived from Dartmouth College, where he had been on the mathematics faculty
for the previous six years as associate professor 1863–66 and full professor 1866–
69. He had received a BS from Dartmouth in 1858 and an MA from Washington
University in 1862 and had taught at Adrian College and Washington University.
Marietta Fletcher and John Sinclair married in November 1870, and Marietta Sin-
clair taught until 1872. Shortly thereafter their children were born; they were sons,
Harry (1872–1934) and Luise Grant (1875–1950), and daughters, Alice (1876–1965),
Mary Emily, and Helen Melora (1880–ca. 1968). Mary Emily Sinclair’s older half-
sisters were Annie, born in 1866, and Isabella, born in 1868. John E. Sinclair, who
invented the ratchet wrench, remained on the faculty of Worcester Polytechnic In-
stitute (WPI) for nearly forty years. The John E. Sinclair chair of mathematics,
the ﬁrst endowed professorship at WPI, was established in 1915 with a gift from
John Sinclair and his children. John Sinclair made the gift to “show aﬀection for
the institute where in the early years Mrs. Sinclair and I taught together. . . ” (R.
L. Norton, “A Short History of Endowed Professorships at WPI”).

Mary Emily Sinclair was born in Worcester, attended public schools there, and
graduated in 1896 from Worcester Classical High School. She then attended Ober-
lin College and while there was a member of the LLS (Litterae laborum solanem,
previously Ladies Literary Society) and president of the college YWCA. After re-
ceiving her undergraduate degree in 1900, she maintained her membership in the
LLS Alumnae Association.

During 1900–01 Sinclair was an assistant teacher in Woodside Seminary, Hart-
ford, Connecticut. She then studied at the University of Chicago and received her
master’s degree in 1903. Her master’s thesis was accompanied by a thread model of
a portion of the unbounded surface discussed in the thesis. Although the German
ﬁrm of Martin Schilling listed her model among its new mathematical models in
the December 1908 issue of the Bulletin of AMS (p. 147), no thread model appears
to be extant. However, in 2003 a sculpture, “Quintic Discriminant I,” of a portion
of the surface was carved by Helaman Ferguson and can be seen on the artist’s
website.

After receiving her master’s degree, Sinclair taught in spring 1903 at Lake Erie
College in Painesville, Ohio. During 1903–04 she held a fellowship at Chicago. The
following year she went to the University of Nebraska as an instructor and remained
there for three years.

In 1907 Sinclair was hired as an instructor at Oberlin College in Ohio, where she
was to serve on the faculty for thirty-seven years. She received her doctorate from
the University of Chicago in 1908, having written her dissertation in the calculus

of variations under the direction of Oskar Bolza, and was promoted to associate
professor at Oberlin.

Sinclair spent her ﬁrst sabbatical year, 1914–15, at Columbia University and
Johns Hopkins University. During that period she adopted two children, Margaret
Emily in 1914 and Richard Elbridge in 1915. Both were born in New York and were
infants at the time of their adoption.

Sinclair spent the year 1922–23 as a Julia C. G. Piatt fellow of the AAUW,
ﬁrst at Cornell and then at Chicago. Her words of appreciation for this grant were
quoted in a 1956 article in the AAUW journal. The year with this fellowship allowed
Sinclair to resume her research in the calculus of variations, and she presented four
papers on that topic in late 1923. In 1925 she was promoted to professor and spent
a year’s sabbatical in Rome and at the Sorbonne. In the summer of 1925, she visited
in Freiburg with Oskar Bolza, her Chicago advisor, who had returned to Germany in
1910. She spent the year 1927–28 on leave from Oberlin at the University of Miami,
Coral Gables, Florida. It appears that her daughter, Margaret, was at that time
attending the Exmoor School there, and in the 1930 census, her son, Richard, was
listed as a cadet at Miami Military Academy in Coral Gables. In spring 1935 she
was on leave at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1939
she became head of the department, and, except for spending the second semester
of 1941–42 on leave at Columbia, she remained in that position until she retired as
professor emeritus in 1944, having been named Clark professor of mathematics in
1941. After retiring, she taught mathematics to Navy V-12 students part time at
Berea College, Kentucky, 1944–46 and was listed in the Berea catalog as “worker
under special agreement.”

Sinclair was a charter member of the MAA and became active in the association
soon after its beginning in 1915. She served on the auditing committee 1917–19 and
was appointed librarian in 1918 and assistant librarian in 1922; she also held the
latter position at least in 1924 and 1925. In 1924 she was appointed to a committee
“to take under advisement the general problem as to how the Association can be of
service to departments of mathematics in the various colleges, and in particular to
formulate standards to which departments of mathematics should conform” (Amer.
Math. Monthly 31 (1924): 166). Finally, she served as a member of the board of
trustees 1936–38.

Soon after she retired from Oberlin, a Mary Emily Sinclair prize was established
there. A faculty committee awarded the prize based on papers delivered to the
college mathematics club. In recognition of the support given her by the AAUW,
Sinclair contributed generously to their fellowship fund. She also contributed to
Oberlin to allow for the establishment of a loan fund for women to use for profes-
sional reasons.

After spending 1944–46 in Kentucky, Sinclair returned to Ohio. On May 12, 1950,
Mary Emily Sinclair was severely injured on the outskirts of Oberlin when she was
beaten by a seventeen-year-old youth who took her car. Accounts over several weeks
in the Elyria, Ohio, Chronicle-Telegram describe the beating and subsequent events.
She suﬀered a skull fracture and a broken nose after having been beaten about the
head with a heavy wire cutting tool. More than a month after the assault, she
gave an account at the trial from a hospital cot accompanied by a nurse and two
ambulance attendants; the attacker was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced
to ten to twenty years in a reformatory.

In 1953 Sinclair moved to Belfast, Maine, where she made her home with her
daughter-in-law, Myrtle Sinclair. Mary Emily Sinclair died in a hospital in Belfast
at age seventy-six in 1955. Among survivors listed were her daughter, two sisters,
six grandchildren, and several nieces and nephews. Interment was in Worcester,
Massachusetts.
