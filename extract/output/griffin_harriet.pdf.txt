GRIFFIN, Harriet. April 6, 1903–January 13, 1991.
Hunter College (BA 1925), Columbia University (MA 1929), New York Uni-
versity (PhD 1939).

Harriet Madeline Griﬃn was born in Brooklyn, New York, the ﬁrst of two daugh-
ters of Mary Madeline (Gully) (1867–1937) and James Harry Griﬃn (1872–1936),
natives of Brooklyn. Her mother had an elementary school education and became a
homemaker after her marriage in 1902. Her father received a high school education;
he was a salesman for a furniture store in 1910 and a buyer for a furniture house
in 1920. Her sister, Jessie (1904–1971), became a high school mathematics teacher
after graduating from Hunter the same year as Harriet. Harriet Griﬃn recalled
in 1985 that her father liked mathematics and encouraged her involvement in the
subject.

Harriet Griﬃn attended Hunter College and while there gave two talks, on the
mathematics of time and of astronomy, to the mathematics club and was a member
of the Newman Club. She won the Thomas Hunter Prize in Mathematics when she
graduated in 1925. She was one of the charter members of Pi Mu Epsilon when it
was established at Hunter in 1925 and served as the chapter’s ﬁrst vice-director; in
the late 1950s she was one of the councilors-general at the national level.

Griﬃn remained at Hunter as a tutor 1926–29 and as an instructor 1929–30.
She earned her master’s degree from Columbia in 1929, having written her master’s
essay, “Modern Geometry in Three Dimensions.” In 1930 the Brooklyn branch of the
female-only Hunter College merged with the Brooklyn branch of the male-only City
College to become the coeducational Brooklyn College. At that time Griﬃn moved
to a position at the newly opened college, and she remained on the faculty there for
thirty-six years. While there she earned her PhD in 1939 at New York University
with a dissertation in abstract algebra. At that time she became a member of the
Key Pin Society, an honorary society at NYU.

Griﬃn began her career at Brooklyn College in 1930 as instructor in the women’s
division. Starting in 1932, the faculty was no longer divided between the men’s and
women’s divisions, and she remained an instructor until 1940. She was assistant
professor 1940–50, associate professor 1950–56, professor 1956–66, and professor
emeritus after her retirement in 1966. Her teaching included advanced calculus,
diﬀerential equations, and abstract algebra and theory of matrices, but her major
interests lay in the theory of numbers. She is listed on the faculty of the graduate
division starting 1946–47. From 1956 to 1964 she taught courses in arithmetic and
algebraic theory of numbers and in theory of matrices, and she was advisor for a
number of master’s theses in number theory in the graduate division at Brooklyn
College. She used her own course notes for number theory and for abstract algebra.
In addition, Griﬃn published a textbook in number theory that appeared in both
hardback and paperback editions. After Griﬃn’s retirement from Brooklyn College
she taught two years, 1966–68, at Molloy College in Rockville Centre, New York.

During World War II, Griﬃn taught mathematics and did vocational counseling
at the United Service Organization in New York. She was a Roman Catholic and
was a member of the Albertus Magnus Guild, an organization for Catholics in
science. She was also a member of the New York Academy of Sciences.
