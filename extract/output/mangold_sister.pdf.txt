MANGOLD, Sister Marie Cecilia. December 5, 1872–February 9, 1934.
Trinity College (Washington, D.C.) (BS 1910, MS 1914), Catholic University
of America (PhD 1929).

Josephine Margaret Mangold was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the daughter of
Mary Anna (Hemann), born in Cincinnati in 1843, and Matthew Mangold, born
in Bavaria, Germany, in about 1833. Eight of their children survived of ten born.
They were Mary P. (b. ca. 1866), Anna (b. ca. 1868), Laura (b. ca. 1870), Philomena
(b. ca. 1871), Josephine (b. 1872), Edward (b. ca. 1877), Matthew (b. 1881), and
Anthony (b. 1882). Their father was a dealer in imported wines, brandies, and
liquor; their mother was a housewife who was widowed by 1900.

Josephine Mangold attended parochial school and later the Academy of the Sis-
ters of Notre Dame de Namur in Cincinnati. In March 1898 she entered the novitiate
of the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur in that city and professed in August 1900.
At that time the Ohio Province of the Sisters of Notre Dame embraced all founda-
tions east of the Rocky Mountains, so after Sister Marie Cecilia Mangold taught in
the high school at Notre Dame Academy in Cincinnati, she was sent to Washington,
D.C., in January 1901, to Trinity College, which now calls itself Trinity (Washing-
ton) University. There she was to assist in the teaching of German and to study
mathematics with Sister Blandina of the original Trinity faculty.

Trinity College was established in 1897 and ﬁrst oﬀered instruction at the post-
secondary level in 1900. Sister Marie Cecilia began to teach mathematics there in
1902. The bachelor’s degree was ﬁrst conferred at Trinity in 1904; that year Sister
Marie Cecilia succeeded Sister Blandina and then directed the mathematics de-
partment until her death in 1934. While teaching at Trinity College, she also took
courses there. Her entrance credits included a Trinity College exam, high school
certiﬁcate, and normal courses she had taken previously. She completed the work
for her BS degree in 1910 with major subjects mathematics and physics. She took
no mathematics courses at Trinity, having been given credit for the elementary
courses from the Notre Dame normal courses and having done all of her advanced
work in both mathematics and physics privately, most likely under the guidance of
faculty from the Catholic University of America. She continued her private study
and earned an MS from Trinity in 1914 with a mathematics major and chemistry
minor. Her master’s degree was granted just prior to the opening of Catholic Sis-
ters College, which formalized the practice of teaching women religious at Catholic
University.

Since women religious were not listed in the register of students at Catholic Uni-
versity until 1928–29, public documents do not indicate when Sister Marie Cecilia
began taking courses there. She studied mathematics under Aubrey E. Landry, his-
tory of science under Rev. Patrick W. Brown, and educational measurement under
T. G. Foran at Catholic University. She wrote two papers in educational measure-
ment, which appeared in 1927 and 1929. After writing a dissertation in algebraic
geometry under the direction of Landry, Sister Marie Cecilia received her PhD in
1929 with a minor in education. She was the second woman religious in this country
to earn a PhD in mathematics; the ﬁrst was Sister Mary Gervase (Kelley) in 1917.
During her more than thirty years on the faculty at Trinity College, Sister Marie
Cecilia was either the only member, or one of two members, of the mathematics
department. In her earliest years in the department she taught trigonometry, solid

geometry, analytic geometry, advanced algebra, diﬀerential and integral calculus,
theory of equations, theory of determinants, and history of mathematics. In 1907–
08 she introduced analytical mechanics, and in 1910–11 advanced calculus and a
teachers’ course with a calculus prerequisite. In 1914–15 three courses for graduates,
diﬀerential equations, vector analysis, and projective geometry, were added to the
curriculum; in 1919–20 practical mathematics for students in physics and practical
mathematics for students in chemistry were introduced; and in 1923–24 a course in
statistical methods was added. The Pascal Circle, the Trinity College mathematics
club, was organized in 1916 with Sister Marie Cecilia the faculty advisor and hon-
orary president. In a memorial article after her death it was reported that “she was
a lover of the classics, and a ﬁrm believer in the adage, ‘The best mathematician
is a student in every ﬁeld’ ” (“In Memoriam”).

Sister Marie Cecilia was in ill health for a number of years before her death at the
college in 1934 at age sixty-one. Among the pallbearers at her funeral were Aubrey
E. Landry and Otto J. Ramler of the mathematics department at Catholic Univer-
sity. She is buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Washington, D.C. The Sr. Marie
Cecilia Memorial Prize was awarded at least once, in 1942, to a senior mathematics
major.
