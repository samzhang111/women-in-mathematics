HULL, Mary Shore (Walker). June 1, 1882–September 18, 1952.
University of Missouri (BA 1903, MA 1904), Yale University (PhD 1909).

Mary Shore Walker was born in Wentzville, Missouri, the daughter of Harriett
F. (Shore) (b. 1855) and Charles Joseph Walker (b. 1846), both of Missouri. At the
time of the 1900 census her parents had been married nineteen years, and ﬁve of
six children born were living. Mary Shore, seventeen, was the eldest, followed by
Charles J., sixteen; Benjamin S., fourteen; Thomas L., ten; and Robert M., four. By
1910 her father, an attorney, was widowed and had moved to Columbia, Missouri.
Mary Shore Walker went to Wentzville high school, just west of St. Louis, after
which she entered Arkansas Industrial University (now University of Arkansas) in
1889. After one year at Arkansas, she transferred to the University of Missouri and
was there from 1900 until 1907. She received her bachelor’s degree in 1903 and
her master’s degree in 1904. From 1904 to 1907 she continued part-time graduate
study and taught as an assistant in mathematics. She joined the AMS in April 1905
and the following year participated in the preliminary meeting of the Southwestern
Section of the AMS that was held in Columbia, Missouri.

Walker’s graduate work at Missouri included theory of numbers with Oliver D.
Kellogg, inﬁnite series and Galois theory of substitutions with L. D. Ames, real
variables and complex variables with E. R. Hedrick, diﬀerential equations with W.
D. A. Westfall, Lie’s theory of continuous groups with G. A. Bliss, Fourier’s series
and potential functions with L. M. DeFoe, projective geometry, and diﬀerential
geometry.

In 1907 Walker was appointed instructor at Missouri and was also granted a
leave of absence to continue her studies. She was at the Yale graduate school for
the academic years 1907–08 and 1908–09 and had courses in diﬀerential equations
and in integral equations with Max Mason, in geometrical analysis with P. F. Smith,
elliptic functions and elementary and advanced theory of real variables with James
Pierpont, celestial mechanics with E. W. Brown, and advanced analytic geome-
try with E. G. Bill. She wrote her dissertation in analysis under the direction of
Pierpont. After receiving her PhD in 1909, Walker returned to the University of
Missouri, where she was instructor of mathematics for two years.

On June 14, 1911, Mary Shore Walker and Albert Wallace Hull, a physicist, were
married in Columbia, Missouri. Albert Hull was born in Connecticut on April 19,
1880, and earned his BA in 1905 and his PhD in 1909 from Yale University. He was
a member of the physics department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute from 1909
until 1914, when he joined the research staﬀ of the General Electric Company as a
physicist at its research laboratory in Schenectady, New York.

The Hulls remained in Schenectady where, from 1928 until his retirement in
1950, Albert Hull was assistant director of the laboratory. In the entry for him in
the National Cyclopedia of American Biography, it was written that he “was the
developer of possibly more types of electron tubes than any other man.” Among
his many honors was election to the National Academy of Sciences. They had two
children: Robert Wallace, born in 1917, and Harriet, born in 1919. Robert W. Hull
earned a PhD in physics from MIT in 1943.

Mary S. W. Hull was active in a number of community organizations. In the late
1930s she reported that she was a member of the College Women’s Club and the
Parent Teacher Association, and was on the Board of Trustees of Brown School in

Schenectady. She also belonged to the First Presbyterian Church and the Daughters
of the American Revolution.

Mary Walker Hull died at Ellis Hospital in Schenectady in 1952 when she was
seventy. She was survived by her husband, her son and daughter, three brothers,
and nieces and nephews. Albert W. Hull died in Schenectady on January 22, 1966,
at age eighty-ﬁve.
