KOHLMETZ, Dorothy Bothwell. January 25, 1906–December 18, 1941.
Oberlin College (BA 1931), Ohio State University (MA 1933, PhD 1937).

Dorothy Bothwell Kohlmetz was the younger of two daughters of Alice Gray
(Bothwell) (ca. 1866–1958) and George William Kohlmetz (ca. 1870–ca. 1949). Her
mother, of Albany, New York, was in the Wellesley College class of 1890. Her father’s
family was from Germany and immigrated to the United States in 1871. Her parents
married in 1896. Ruth Willis (1899–1991), her older sister, graduated from the
College for Women of Western Reserve University in 1923, having been elected to
Phi Beta Kappa in 1922; she was a junior high school teacher in Lakewood, Ohio,
at the time of her mother’s death. Most evidence indicates that Dorothy Kohlmetz
was born in Albany, New York, although Cleveland, Ohio, appears as her place of
birth in at least one source at Ohio State University. Her father was a purchasing
agent for the Cleveland Twist Drill Company and was also author of bibliographical
notes for a collection of editions of a book of local interest.

Kohlmetz attended public secondary school in Cleveland except for her last year.
In 1924–25 she attended the Laurel School, a preparatory school also in Cleveland,
from which she graduated in June 1925. She then studied at the Cleveland Institute
of Music 1925–26.

Kohlmetz entered Oberlin in the fall of 1926 as a student in the Conservatory of
Music but later changed her classiﬁcation and graduated from the College of Arts
and Sciences with a BA in December 1931. She entered Ohio State University in
the winter quarter of 1932 and did course work there until spring quarter 1935,
receiving her master’s degree in 1933. She held a university scholarship in spring
1935 and, despite suﬀering from rheumatic heart disease, she received her doctorate
in December 1937.

Dorothy Kohlmetz had been living at her family’s home in Cleveland Heights,
Ohio, before her death at the Cleveland Clinic Hospital at age thirty-ﬁve in 1941.
She had been ill for more than six years and died a few days after major surgery.
She was survived by her parents and her sister.
Organizational aﬃliation: Phi Beta Kappa.
