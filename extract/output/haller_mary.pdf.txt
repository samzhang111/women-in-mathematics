HALLER, Mary E. June 15, 1901–June 16, 1970.
University of Washington (BA 1924, MS 1931, PhD 1934).

Mary Elizabeth Haller was born in Cumberland, Maryland, the second of at least
four daughters of Winifred (Buckey) (b. 1875) and William Henry Haller (b. 1875),
both of Maryland. Her elder sister, Elsie C., was three years older than she; her
younger sisters were Isabella, about three years younger, and Winifred R., about
eight years younger. Her father worked for the railroad, as a clerk in 1900 and as a
telegraph operator in 1910.

Haller attended public schools in Cumberland, Maryland, and graduated from
Allegany County High School in 1916. The next two years she was enrolled in
the Frostburg State Normal School (now Frostburg State University) in Frostburg,
Maryland, from which she graduated in 1918. She taught in elementary schools for
the next ﬁve years. She was an instructor in the public schools in Maryland 1918–20
and in Renton, Washington, 1920–23. While teaching in Renton, near Seattle, she
attended the University of Washington and in 1924 earned her bachelor’s degree in
education with a major in mathematics and a minor in economics. The next ﬁve
years, 1924–29, Haller taught in the high school in Renton and, after successfully
teaching and demonstrating professional growth, earned the Washington State Life
Diploma.

In 1929 Haller returned to the University of Washington, where she was a teach-
ing fellow in the mathematics department 1929–31 while she worked toward her
1931 master’s degree with a thesis in projective geometry and a minor in physics.
While continuing her graduate work at the University of Washington she was an
associate in mathematics 1931–34 and a Loretta Denny fellow 1933–34. She re-
ceived her PhD in 1934 with a minor in physics and with a doctoral dissertation
in algebraic geometry directed by R. M. Winger, who also directed her master’s
thesis.

In 1934–35 Haller was professor and dean of women at Gooding College in Idaho.
At the time she was there the college was under pressure to oﬀer non-academic
subjects; it closed three years later. It appears that she studied at the University
of Chicago in the summer of 1935. After her year at Gooding, Haller returned to
the University of Washington where she was instructor 1935–41, assistant professor
1941–49, associate professor 1949–65, and associate professor emeritus after her
retirement in December 1965. Haller was among fourteen faculty members whose
teaching was recognized in “Class Acts” in the September 1999 issue of Columns,
the University of Washington alumni magazine. A tribute from a student describes
his experience in about 1947:

The “Doc,” as she was known, had a reputation for working stu-
dents to death and I was more than apprehensive about attending
her lectures.

About 20 students arrived at the ﬁrst scheduled class meeting . . .
All of a sudden, here comes an imposing ﬁgure of a woman without
the least bit of friendliness on her face. She wrote her name on the
blackboard, turned to the class and said in ﬁrm tones, “My name
is Dr. Mary Haller and I want you to be advised right now that all
of you will do twice as much work as any other class, you will not
miss a class unless you are near death, if you even drop a pencil

during one of my lectures, you might as well transfer to another
class. Now, those of you who don’t like my terms are free to go
without prejudice.”

At the end of her announcement, at least 10 of the assembled
group left the room without even a glance to see who was crazy
enough to remain. When the door to the classroom ﬁnally closed,
“Doc” turned to us and with a great big smile said, “Now that
we’ve ridden ourselves of the quitters, let’s get started. I assure all
of you that surviving this class will be a feather in your cap, and you
will become good engineers.” True to her word, our class became
as one and lifelong friendships started. (House, “Class Acts: Mary
Haller”)

In 1945 Haller’s signature was one of eighteen on a petition asking for the forma-
tion of the Paciﬁc Northwest Section of the MAA, and during the 1950s she attended
many of the section meetings. Her continued interest in physics was demonstrated
the summer before her promotion to associate professor when Haller attended a
three-day symposium on electro-magnetic theory at MIT that was sponsored by
the AMS, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the American Institute
of Physics, and the Institute of Radio Engineers.

In addition to the organizational aﬃliations listed below, Haller belonged to Zeta
Mu Tau, a local mathematics honor society; Sigma Pi Sigma, a national physics
honor society; and Pi Lambda Theta, a national honor and professional association
in education. She was also a member of the American Society for Engineering
Education. She was a Methodist and a member of the Wesley Club and Kappa Phi,
a club for Christian university women.

Haller remained in Seattle after her retirement and died as a consequence of
heart disease at Swedish Hospital in Seattle in 1970, the day after her sixty-ninth
birthday.
Organizational aﬃliations: AMS, MAA, AAUW, Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi, Pi Mu
Epsilon.
