MULLIKIN, Anna M. March 7, 1893–August 24, 1975.
Goucher College (BA 1915), University of Pennsylvania (MA 1919, PhD 1922).

Anna Margaret Mullikin was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the youngest of four
children of Sophia Ridgely (Battee) (1854–1921) and William Lawrence Mullikin
(1846–1915), both natives of Maryland. William Mullikin’s occupation was listed
as leather hider in 1900, and at that time the household consisted of his wife,
his mother-in-law, his sister-in-law, the four children, and a cook. In 1910 William
Mullikin’s occupation was listed as leather dealer. The Mullikin children were Mary
Hester (b. 1884), Richard Nicholas (b. 1888), Caroline Battee (1890–1969), and
Anna, who later used the name Anne. All of the Mullikin daughters graduated
from Goucher College and became public high school teachers. The son earned a
PhD in chemistry and worked in industry.

After graduating from Goucher College in 1915, Mullikin taught in private schools
for three years. She was at Science Hill School in Shelbyville, Kentucky, 1915–17 and
was an instructor at Mary Baldwin Seminary in Staunton, Virginia, 1917–18. She
entered the University of Pennsylvania with a university scholarship in mathemat-
ics for 1918–19 and received her master’s degree at the end of the academic year.
The next year she continued her work at the University of Pennsylvania, and at
the same time she taught at the Stevens School in the Germantown neighborhood
of Philadelphia.

Mullikin worked in topology with R. L. Moore, who had been at Pennsylvania
since 1911. Having done his undergraduate work at the University of Texas, Moore
returned to Texas in the fall of 1920. He was clearly interested in having Mullikin
at Texas, and in the spring of 1920, during negotiations with the department there,
Moore wrote that he hoped Texas would oﬀer her an instructorship. In an earlier
letter, he had described her as “one of the best students I ever had” (Lewis, “The
Building of the University of Texas Mathematics Faculty,” 228). Thus, Mullikin
spent the year 1920–21 as instructor at Texas. The following year she returned to
study at the University of Pennsylvania and simultaneously taught at the Oak Lane
Country Day School. Even though Moore remained at Texas, he was advisor for
Mullikin’s dissertation culminating in her doctorate from Pennsylvania in 1922.

Mullikin’s dissertation was an important work in topology, and her main result
was often referred to as “Miss Mullikin’s theorem.” In a 1924 paper in the Polish
journal Fundamenta Mathematicae, R. L. Moore noted that “a proposition which is
a logical consequence of . . . theorems of Janiszewski’s has been recently established
by Miss Anna M. Mullikin in her Doctor’s dissertation, which will appear soon in
the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society. This paper had gone to
the printers before either Miss Mullikin or I was aware that the proposition had
already been proved. Apparently Janiszewski’s paper is printed in Polish” (6:190fn).
Zygmunt Janiszewski’s paper appeared in 1913 and he died in early 1920. Mullikin’s
paper appeared in 1922, and Moore learned of Janiszewski’s results from a 1923
paper by Stefan Straszewicz. By 1928, American mathematicians had begun to call
the result the “Janiszewski-Mullikin theorem”; in the many citations to her work
that have appeared through at least the 1980s, both names of the theorem appear.
Thomas Bartlow and David Zitarelli discuss the mathematics in great detail in
“Who Was Miss Mullikin?” in the American Mathematical Monthly (forthcoming).
In 1988 Mary Ellen Rudin, one of Moore’s most well-known students, described

Mullikin’s thesis as “fantastic” (Albers, Reid, and Rudin, “An Interview with Mary
Ellen Rudin,” 123).

After receiving her PhD, Mullikin became a high school teacher. She taught at
William Penn High School in Philadelphia the academic year 1922–23 and moved
to Germantown High School, also in Philadelphia, in 1923. She was a teacher at
Germantown High School and became head of the mathematics department in 1952.
She remained there until her retirement in 1959. In 1954 Goucher College honored
Mullikin with an alumnae achievement citation. During the late 1950s and early
1960s she coauthored textbooks with Ethel L. Grove, who had been at Cuyahoga
Heights High School in Cleveland, and Ewart L. Grove of the University of Alabama.
While at Germantown High School, Mullikin taught a future (1952) R. L. Moore
student, Mary-Elizabeth Hamstrom. In 1998 Hamstrom wrote to one of the authors
that Mullikin’s “interest in me was very important.” The two became friends, and
Mullikin gave Hamstrom her “ﬁrst dog as a high school graduation present.” Mul-
likin told her that she had chosen high school teaching because research was harder
and the money was not as good. In 1930 Mullikin is listed as a Republican and
an Episcopalian. In 1956 she endowed the Julia Morgan Fund at the First United
Methodist Church of Germantown. Mullikin and Morgan had become friends when
both were studying at the University of Pennsylvania. Julia Morgan became a
Methodist medical missionary in China before returning to the United States and
subsequently teaching medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
Anna Mullikin was residing in Philadelphia at the time of her death at age
eighty-two in 1975. She was survived by two nieces and a nephew and was interred
in Mt. Olivet Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland.
