SPEER, Mary (Taylor). March 27, 1906–November 23, 1966.
University of Pittsburgh (BA 1926, MA 1928, PhD 1935).

Mary Margaret Taylor was the only daughter and third of four children of Hallie
Blanche Virginia (Criss) (1875–1959) and Albert Aaron Taylor (1872–1937), both
of Washington County in the southwestern part of Pennsylvania, a few miles from
Pittsburgh. Her parents were married in 1899. Taylor’s mother attended common
school and several terms at the state normal school and was a teacher in a one-room
school and a housewife; her father attended common school and was a carpenter,
mason, cabinet maker, and general contractor, having engaged in home study in
addition to common school. They had four children: Joseph Stewart (b. 1901),
Albert Alfred (b. 1902), Mary Margaret, and Edward A. (b. 1913), all born in
Midway, Pennsylvania.

Mary Taylor grew up in Midway and attended the three-year high school there,
1918–21. The following year she took the classical course in the Carnegie High
School on the outskirts of Pittsburgh and graduated in 1922. She was awarded
the four-year college scholarship, given annually on the basis of a competitive ex-
amination, from Washington County. In her undergraduate years, 1922–26, at the
University of Pittsburgh she carried majors in both mathematics and Latin. She
was elected to Sigma Kappa Phi, a national foreign language honorary fraternity,
and to QUAX, a women’s science honorary society at Pittsburgh, before graduating
with highest honor, the only recipient of a BA so honored in 1926. A brother recalls
that she was oﬀered graduate assistantships in both mathematics and Latin.

Taylor held a graduate teaching assistantship at Pittsburgh from 1926 to 1930. In
this period she earned her master’s degree in 1928, studied in the summer of 1928 at
the University of Chicago, and continued work toward the PhD at Pittsburgh. From
1930 to 1934 Taylor was instructor of mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh
at Johnstown, and in the academic year 1934–35 she was back at the Pittsburgh
campus as a graduate assistant to complete the work for her PhD.

In 1935 Taylor married Eugene R. Speer (1903–1978), a Pennsylvania native
who also graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 1926, did graduate work
there in mathematics and physics 1926–28, and graduated from the University of
Pittsburgh law school. They remained in Pittsburgh, where she taught at her alma
mater, and he practiced law. In 1936–37 she is listed in the university catalogue
as Speer and as a graduate assistant. From 1937–38 to 1942–43 she is listed as an
instructor in mathematics.

The Speers had three children: Virginia Ellen (1941–1981), Eugene R., born in
1943, and Susan Margaret, born in 1947. All three children did their undergraduate
work in mathematics. The elder daughter did a year of graduate work in mathemat-
ics in England as a Fulbright scholar and became a computer software manager. The
two younger children earned PhD’s in mathematics and computer science, respec-
tively. Eugene Speer is in the department of mathematics at Rutgers University;
Susan Speer Owicki was a faculty member in the department of electrical engineer-
ing at Stanford University, later earned an MA in counseling psychology, and is a
licensed marriage and family therapist.

In 1986 Mary Speer’s son reported that she continued her position at the univer-
sity until sometime after the birth of their elder daughter and before his birth, and

that his mother “recounted that she left the University of Pittsburgh, and mathe-
matics teaching, because men junior to her were promoted to Associate Professor
while she was not, and because she was told that this was because the men had
families to support and needed the money” (Smithsonian questionnaire).

Mary Speer was an involved Presbyterian throughout her life and was an active
member and administrator in Girl Scouts of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, from
the early 1950s until her death. She died of cancer at age sixty in Pittsburgh in
1966.
