KLOYDA, Sister M. Thomas `a Kempis. May 15, 1896–March 19, 1977.
College of Saint Teresa (BA 1920), University of Michigan (MA 1926, PhD
1936).

Sister Mary Thomas `a Kempis Kloyda was born Sophia Kloyda, the ﬁrst of
three children of Mary (Kurash) (1875–1954) and John L. Kloyda (1869–1940).
Her mother was born in Iowa and her father in Prague, Bohemia. According to
the 1900 census, her father immigrated to the United States in 1882 and was later
naturalized. In 1900 her parents had been married ﬁve years and there were two
children: Sophia, age four, born in Manly, Iowa, and George, born in July 1899 in
Minnesota. The household also contained Mary Kloyda, age ﬁfty, Sophia Kloyda’s
paternal grandmother. The family was living in Jackson, Minnesota, just north
of the Iowa border, and her father worked as a bartender. The third child was
Agnes (1902–1993). In 1920 and 1930 the family was living in Minneapolis, where
her father worked as a machinist. In the 1930 census her mother was described as
operator of a sewing machine.

Sophia Kloyda earned her diploma from Columbus High School in Austin, Min-
nesota, in 1914. She taught second and third grades the following year. In the fall
of 1915 she entered the College of Saint Teresa (now closed), a private college for
women sponsored by the Sisters of Saint Frances, in Winona, Minnesota. She was in
residence there until 1918 and entered the Novitiate of the Sisters of Saint Francis
in Rochester, Minnesota, in January 1918. She was again in residence at the college
during 1919–20 and received her bachelor’s degree in June 1920 with a major in
mathematics and minors in botany and Latin. She was also an instructor at St.
Claire Academy 1917–20.

After her graduation from college, Sister M. Thomas `a Kempis taught for four
years in high schools: in Minnesota 1920–22 and in Ohio 1922–24. In the summer
of 1922 she began her graduate work at the University of Michigan and completed
all of her work for the master’s degree in November 1926 with courses taken every
summer except that of 1925. She was principal of Saint Augustine High School in
Minnesota during 1924–26.

In the fall of 1926 Sister Thomas `a Kempis began teaching physics at the College
of Saint Teresa, where she had done her undergraduate work, while also continuing
her graduate work in mathematics at Michigan. She studied at Michigan during the
summers of 1928 and 1929, the academic years 1930–31 and 1934–35, and again in
the summer of 1935 for work on her dissertation, which she subsequently completed
in the history of mathematics under the direction of Louis C. Karpinski. She received
her doctorate in February 1936, a year after Sister M. Leontius Schulte, also a
student of Karpinski at Michigan and her colleague at the College of Saint Teresa.
The following year she published an article summarizing her study of linear and
quadratic equations in Europe from 1550 to 1660; the article included a bibliography
of primary sources on that topic.

Sister M. Thomas `a Kempis continued her work at the College of Saint Teresa.
She was head of the physics department for several years before serving as head
of the mathematics department 1939–49. Her work at the college was interrupted
for ﬁve years when she was asked to serve as principal of Saint Mary High School
in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, 1949–50 and of Saint Joseph High School in Ironton,

Ohio, 1950–53; she was instructor of mathematics and science at Cotter Senior
High School in Winona, Minnesota, 1953–54.

In 1954 Sister M. Thomas `a Kempis returned to the College of Saint Teresa,
where she was again head of the department of mathematics 1954–69 and professor
of mathematics from 1969 until her retirement from full-time service in 1972. Dur-
ing her years at the College of Saint Teresa, she was active professionally, especially
with the Minnesota Section of the MAA, for which she was section chairman in
1934–35 and a member of the executive committee 1935–36, 1939–40, and 1962–63.
She taught in NSF institutes for elementary school teachers during the summers of
1963 and 1964 and was a consultant at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical Uni-
versity during the summer of 1965. She was a member of the Minnesota Academy
of Science. She wrote a number of articles during her professional life. Most were
historical articles about individual mathematicians, many of whom were women.

Sister Mary Thomas `a Kempis Kloyda worked part time at the college until Sep-
tember 1976, when she was eighty, at which time she was forced by failing eyesight
and general health considerations to move to the Assisi Heights Motherhouse in
Rochester, Minnesota. She died the following spring at Saint Mary’s Hospital in
Rochester and was buried in Calvary Cemetery in Rochester.
