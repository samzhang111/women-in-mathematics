HASEMAN, Mary Gertrude. March 6, 1889–April 9, 1979.
Indiana University (BA 1910), Bryn Mawr College (PhD 1917).

Mary Gertrude Haseman, was born in or near Linton, Indiana, the seventh of
nine children of Elizabeth Christine (Schultze) (1853–1929) and John Dieterich (also
Diedrich, Diederich) Haseman (1847–1924), both born near Linton. Her siblings
were Joseph H. (1876–1972); William Peter (1878–1932); Charles (1880–1931); John
D. Jr. (1882–1969); Leonard (1884–1969); Oscar (1886–1967); Bertha (1891–1970);
and Arthur (1895–1969). All nine children from this farm family in central Indiana
were college educated, and ﬁve of them earned doctorates. Gertrude Haseman’s
six older brothers all received bachelor’s degrees from Indiana University; ﬁve also
earned master’s degrees from Indiana. Four of the six earned PhD’s: William Peter
from the University of Pennsylvania in physics in 1907, Charles from G¨ottingen in
mathematics in 1907, Leonard from Cornell in entomology in 1910, and John from
Columbia in zoology in 1911. Her younger brother and sister both earned master’s
degrees.

Gertrude Haseman attended high school in Linton, where her oldest brother was
superintendent of schools. She entered Indiana University in 1907 and graduated
cum laude in mathematics in 1910. Cora Hennel and Gertrude McCain were fellow
students at Indiana; Hennel was a graduate student the entire time Haseman was
an undergraduate, while McCain was a senior 1907–08 and returned for a short
period in 1909 as a graduate student. Haseman ﬁrst took a position as professor
of mathematics at Vincennes University, then a two-year college in southwestern
Indiana, for the year 1910–11.

From 1911 to 1915 Haseman was a graduate student at Bryn Mawr College:
as a graduate scholar in mathematics 1911–12 and as a resident fellow 1913–1915.
She worked as a tutor in the Bryn Mawr Tutoring School from 1912 to 1915.
During her ﬁrst year at Bryn Mawr, she gave presentations to the journal club on
projective groups in three dimensions and on a method of successive approximations
or iteration; her fellow graduate student presenters that year were Gertrude I.
McCain and Eula A. Weeks (King). In 1913–14 she reported on two papers by A.
Kneser in algebraic geometry. She attended lectures of Frank Morley, and probably
also Arthur Coble, at the Johns Hopkins University during 1915–17, while she also
taught at the Roland Park Country School in Baltimore. She wrote her dissertation
under the direction of Charlotte A. Scott and passed her ﬁnal examination in May
1916. Although her doctorate was not awarded by Bryn Mawr until 1917, her name
was submitted to School and Society for their “list of American doctorates conferred
during the academic year 1915–1916” and appears on the list of doctorates in
mathematics published in the Bulletin of the AMS (23 (1917): 197). Haseman noted
in her dissertation vita that at Bryn Mawr she also studied under the direction of
J. R. Conner in mathematics and W. B. Huﬀ in physics, the subject in which she
minored.

The results of Haseman’s dissertation have appeared in books and papers in
knot theory, especially since the mid-1980s. In a 1988 review in the Bulletin of the
AMS of two such books, Joan Birman noted that T. P. Kirkman, C. N. Little, and
Haseman “assembled the ﬁrst tables of knots, which have been used ever since,
and can be seen, modulo surprisingly few corrections, at the end of both of the
books under review. . . . Empirical data is of course at the heart of any subject,

and so this set of painfully assembled data has had an enormous impact on the
subject” (19:552). In an essay in The History and Science of Knots, Pieter van der
Griend describes her work as a “brave expedition into the then uncharted regions
of 12-crossing knot-projections” and calls her dissertation “charming” (1995, 223).
In 1917–18 Haseman taught at the Harcum School in Bryn Mawr and during
1918–19 at the high school in Linton, Indiana. She joined the University of Illi-
nois faculty as instructor in 1920. While there she studied during two summers in
the early 1920s at the University of Chicago, hearing lectures of E. J. Wilczynski
and E. H. Moore. While she was at Illinois, Haseman and a colleague, Josephine
Burns Glasgow, spoke at an MAA meeting about preparing students to take calculus
who had minimal mathematics in high school. They also produced a mimeographed
mathematics text, Freshman Mathematics: Book 1, which is in the library at South-
ern Illinois University Edwardsville. Haseman spoke at another MAA meeting about
curve tracing and wrote a paper on that subject, a copy of which is in the University
of Illinois mathematics library; the paper is based on a course of lectures given at
Bryn Mawr by Charlotte Scott. In 1925 and 1926 Haseman served as second vice
president of Sigma Delta Epsilon, the graduate women’s scientiﬁc fraternity.

Haseman resigned her position at Illinois on October 28, 1927, and left on Jan-
uary 31, 1928. February 1 was the opening day for the new Junior College of Con-
necticut (now the University of Bridgeport), and Haseman had been hired as its
ﬁrst professor of mathematics. She was there brieﬂy before serving as professor of
mathematics and advisor of women at Hartwick College in Oneonta, New York,
during the academic year 1928–29. She left after that year, with evidence suggest-
ing a dispute with the college administration. The April 1929 issue of the student
newspaper, Hilltops of Hartwick , contained the dedication, “To Dr. Mary Gertrude
Haseman who, by her unfailing patience and encouragement has endeared herself
to both students and faculty of Hartwick College.” She was replaced at Hartwick
by Roxanna Vivian.

After leaving Hartwick, Gertrude Haseman spent some time with her brother,
Leonard Haseman, who was then head of the department of entomology at the
University of Missouri in Columbia. A nephew reported that she held a teaching
job in the south before returning in the summer of 1936 to live in her former home
in Linton, where she remained until about the last year of her life. Some of the
time one of her brothers was there; later she lived alone and was cared for by two
nephews.

In a conversation with one of the authors in 1986, a nephew said Haseman played
piano and harp and was very musical. He said she was interested in lawn work and
that she gardened, canned, and was a good cook. Never in the hospital before her
ﬁnal illness, she spent about the last year of her life in a nursing home before her
death at age ninety at Greene County General Hospital in Linton. Her siblings
predeceased her, and her only survivors were nieces and nephews. She is buried,
along with several family members, in Memory Hill Cemetery in Linton.
