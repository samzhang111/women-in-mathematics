PENCE, Sallie E. September 5, 1893–July 26, 1989.
University of Kentucky (BA 1914, MA 1928), University of Illinois (PhD 1937).

Sallie Elizabeth Pence was born in Lexington, Kentucky, a daughter of Belle
(Kelly) (1862–1954) and Merry Lewis Pence (1854–1938), natives of Kentucky who
married in 1882. She was the seventh of eight children, with older siblings Alice
(b. 1883), Merry Lewis (1884–1966), Kate (b. 1886), Christina (b. 1887), Mary (b.
1889), and Edgar (b. 1891), and younger brother, Robert (1898–1954). Her father,
Merry Lewis Pence, graduated in 1881 from what was then the Agricultural and
Mechanical College of Kentucky, and earned a master’s degree in 1885. He joined the
New York Mathematical Society in 1891 and remained a member through at least
1894 when it became the American Mathematical Society. He taught for over ﬁfty
years and for nearly forty years served at what eventually became the University
of Kentucky, ﬁrst as professor of civil engineering and physics and then as head of
the physics department that he established. Pence Hall on the campus is named for
him. The university gives the Merry Lewis Pence Award for the outstanding senior
physics major annually. Four of his ﬁve daughters graduated from the University
of Kentucky.

Sallie Pence attended public schools in Lexington, Kentucky, for ten years and
the academy of the State University of Kentucky for one year before graduating
in 1910 and entering the State University, renamed the University of Kentucky
in 1916. She received her bachelor’s degree in 1914, having majored in modern
languages. While at the university she was a member of the women’s basketball
team; a campus drama production company; Mortar Board; and Alpha Gamma
Delta, a social sorority.

From 1914 until 1927 Pence taught in high schools in Owensboro, Bellevue,
Hazard, and Morganﬁeld, Kentucky, and she attended George Peabody College for
Teachers in Nashville, Tennessee, during the summer of 1921. She began work in
mathematics at the University of Kentucky in the summer of 1922. After spending
the summers of 1926 and 1927 as a graduate student and the following year as a
fellow, she completed the work for her master’s degree. Upon receiving that degree
in 1928 Pence became an instructor at Murray Normal School and Teachers College
(now Murray State University) in Kentucky. The following year she was hired as
an instructor at the University of Kentucky, where, except for leaves, she spent the
remainder of her career.

While teaching at Kentucky, Pence continued taking mathematics courses there
before attending Cornell University during the summers of 1932 and 1933. Virgil
Snyder, from whom she took courses both summers, described her as “a very good
student” at the end of the ﬁrst and “an excellent student” at the end of the second
(Cornell University Graduate School Files). Pence took a leave of absence from
Kentucky to attend the University of Illinois 1934–35. She was an assistant in
mathematics at Illinois in 1935–36, remained for the summer, and returned for the
second semester of 1936–37 to complete the work for her PhD. Her major ﬁeld was
geometry with a minor in astronomy.

In 1938, a year after receiving her doctorate, Pence was promoted to assistant
professor at Kentucky. She was promoted to associate professor in 1947, served as
chairman of the division of physical science 1954–55, and was promoted to professor
in 1956, seven years before her retirement in 1963. While at Kentucky, Pence was

active in professional organizations, particularly the MAA. She was secretary of
the Kentucky Section 1947–49 and chairman of the section 1953–54; she was oﬃcial
MAA lecturer to Kentucky high schools in 1958–59 and was executive director of
the MAA high school lecture program under the sponsorship of the National Science
Foundation 1962–63. In 1957 Pence directed a summer seminar for in-service high
school mathematics teachers. Pence was also executive director of the University of
Kentucky high school honors examinations in mathematics 1959–63.

Immediately after her retirement in 1963 Pence headed for Europe with a friend
for a four-month trip to Britain, France, Switzerland, Greece, and ﬁnally Turkey,
where she was to be entertained by the parents of one of her students. Pence did
some part-time teaching at the University of Kentucky after her retirement, and
from 1964 until 1966 she was professor at East Carolina College (now East Carolina
University) in Greenville, North Carolina. She was a visiting distinguished professor
there 1966–67.

Pence had a number of interests and appeared to excel in each. These included
golf, philately, photography, and travel. She belonged to the Winchester, Kentucky,
Country Club and the Henry Clay Philatelic Society, the latter of which awarded
her ﬁrst place for having the best stamp collection among its members in 1939.
She was a member of the Lexington Camera Club, was described as an expert
photographer, and was frequently invited to give slide presentations and talks to
various clubs and professional groups about her travels. She was a member of the
Lexington Business and Professional Women’s Club, the Woman’s Club of Central
Kentucky, the Kentucky Archaeological Society, the Order of the Eastern Star, and
the Daughters of the American Revolution, among others. She was also active in
the Calvary Baptist Church, was a member of the Business Women’s Missionary
Circle, and described herself as a Democrat.

Sallie Pence died at the age of ninety-ﬁve at the Sayre Christian Village Nursing
Home in Lexington. She was survived by several nieces and nephews. The Sallie E.
Pence Award was established by the University of Kentucky board of trustees and
is given annually to outstanding mathematics and mathematics education majors
at the University of Kentucky who plan to pursue a career in teaching.
