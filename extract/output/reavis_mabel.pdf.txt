REAVIS, Mabel (Griﬃn). August 28, 1907–November 19, 1999.
Duke University (Woman’s College) (BA 1928), Duke University (MA 1930,
PhD 1933).

Mabel Jeanette Griﬃn was the youngest of four children of Naomi Frances
(Burke) (1874–1966) and Charles A. Griﬃn (1871–1958). Her parents were both
born in Chatham County, in central North Carolina. Her mother was born in
Pittsboro, where she attended the Pittsboro Academy; her father attended county
schools and became a carpenter and home builder. They were married on Janu-
ary 9, 1895. The two older children, Pearl (1895–1975) and George Sidney (1898–
1981), were born in Pittsboro; Theodore Alton (1904-1964) and Mabel were born
in Durham, North Carolina. Pearl Griﬃn attended Duke University, and George
and Theodore attended the city schools in Durham. George became a hosiery mill
owner, and Theodore was in the insurance business.

Mabel Griﬃn was one of the ﬁrst undergraduates at Duke University’s Woman’s
College, which was founded in 1924 as a coordinate college for women. She received
her bachelor’s degree magna cum laude in 1928. The next year she had a high-school
teaching position and then returned to Duke for graduate work in mathematics.
She had a graduate scholarship 1929–31, a graduate fellowship 1931–32, and was
an assistant at Duke 1929–32. She completed the work for her master’s degree in
1930. She taught in high school 1932–33, the year before she received her PhD with
a dissertation written under the direction of J. M. Thomas. Ruth Wyckliﬀe Stokes
had received her doctorate from Duke two years earlier, the ﬁrst in mathematics
from Duke. After receiving her doctorate, Mabel Griﬃn taught one more year in
high school before teaching two years, 1934–36, as professor at Campbell Junior
College (now Campbell University) in Buies Creek, North Carolina.

On August 3, 1936, Mabel Griﬃn married L. Boyd Reavis, who was born in
1907 in Warrenton, North Carolina. L. B. Reavis graduated from Campbell Junior
College in 1930. He received further education from Wake Forest University in
Winston Salem, North Carolina; Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in
Fort Worth, Texas; and Howard Payne College (now University) in Brownwood,
Texas, from which he earned a Doctor of Divinity degree. After their marriage,
they lived in Fort Worth and then Temple, Texas.

For the ﬁrst four years of their marriage, 1936–40, Mabel Reavis taught as as-
sistant professor at Mary Hardin–Baylor College (now University of Mary Hardin–
Baylor) in nearby Belton, Texas. Mary Hardin–Baylor was established in the mid-
nineteenth century as the women’s division of Baylor University and remained a
women’s college until 1971. Mabel Reavis later served as a trustee of the college.

In 1939 L. Boyd Reavis took the ﬁrst of several positions as pastor in Texas.
During the next ten years he was pastor of the First Baptist Church in Plainview
1939–45 and of the First Baptist Church in Paris 1945–49. During this time their
three children were born. Raynor Boyd was born in December 1940, graduated
from Baylor University, and became an executive with an aerospace corporation.
Roma Jean, born in April 1943, earned both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree
from Baylor, and became co-host of the Don Wade and Roma Morning Show on
WLS radio in Chicago in 1985. Ralph Griﬃn, born in November 1946, graduated
from Texas Christian University and then earned a PhD in education from North
Texas State University before holding positions in academia.

In 1949 the Reavis family moved to High Point, North Carolina, where L. Boyd
Reavis was pastor of the Green Street Baptist Church for the next four years. Mabel
Reavis resumed her career as professor and head of the mathematics department at
High Point College 1950–53. In 1953 they returned to Texas, where L. B. Reavis was
pastor of the First Baptist Church in Denton for the next two years. In 1955 they
moved to Fort Worth, where they remained for forty years. He became director of
development for Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and held that position
until his retirement in 1973.

In 1955 Mabel Reavis began an eighteen-year period as a mathematics faculty
member at Texas Christian University. She was assistant professor 1955–58, as-
sociate professor 1958–73, and retired as professor emeritus in 1973. During ﬁve
summers in the 1960s she was director of the mathematics section of the NSF
summer science institute at Texas Christian. Mabel Reavis wrote in 1981,

Teaching is totally satisfying to me. In addition to my enjoyment
of subject matter I ﬁnd the students themselves and their devel-
opment of potential just as important to me. Counseling outside
the classroom has consumed much of my time at T. C. U. The
demands of rearing 3 children, being supportive of my husband in
his ministry, and University teaching have precluded my pursuance
of further research in mathematics except for direction of several
Master’s theses. (Smithsonian questionnaire)

During her years as a student, Reavis became a member of the education honor
societies Delta Kappa Gamma and Kappa Delta Pi, and the physics honor society
Sigma Pi Sigma. Later she served as vice president of the TCU chapter of Phi
Beta Kappa and served on the TCU faculty senate. She was a member of the TCU
Faculty Woman’s Club and the Seminary Woman’s Club at Southwestern Seminary.
She also belonged to the Ridglea Country Club in Fort Worth.

Reavis was a Baptist and included various church-related activities among her
interests. She served as an Associational Young People’s leader, edited church bul-
letins, was a member of various study clubs, lectured for local clubs and societies,
and engaged in Bible teaching. She listed reading and travel among her interests
and, in 1981, described her political aﬃliation as Independent. In 1991 she and her
husband established the L. B. and Mabel Reavis professorship and scholarship pro-
gram at Campbell University; Reavis scholars are honored for leading their churches
in growth and evangelism.

L. Boyd Reavis died in their Fort Worth home in March 1995. Mabel Reavis
remained in Fort Worth until 1998, when she moved to Chicago to be close to her
daughter. Mabel Griﬃn Reavis died in her Chicago home in November 1999 at age
ninety-two. She was survived by her three children, seven grandchildren, and three
great-grandchildren. She was buried in Laurel Land Memorial Park in Fort Worth.
