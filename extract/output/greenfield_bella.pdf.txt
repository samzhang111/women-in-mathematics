GREENFIELD, Bella (Manel). October 13, 1915–April 3, 2010.
Hunter College (BA 1935), Columbia University (MA 1936), New York Uni-
versity (PhD 1939).

Bella Manel was born in New York City, the only child of Tillie (1887–1971) and
Jacob Manel (1882–1956). Both of her parents were born in Poland, and they were
married there in 1911 before immigrating to the United States in 1914. In 1930 the
family was living in the Bronx, and her father worked for a dress manufacturer.

Manel graduated from Morris High School in the Bronx in 1931 and was rec-
ognized as one of the twelve most distinguished in scholarship of the more than
400 graduates of the school. She entered Hunter College in the fall and was elected
to Phi Beta Kappa during her junior year. While at Hunter most of Manel’s work
in mathematics was taken with Mina Rees, and the two remained friends over the
years. At the Hunter College graduation ceremonies in June 1935, the Joseph A.
Gillet scholarship of forty-ﬁve dollars for proﬁciency in mathematics was divided
equally between Manel and another Hunter student. Manel graduated summa cum
laude. Manel then studied at Columbia University and received her master’s degree
in 1936 with a thesis directed by Joseph Fels Ritt on Weyl’s foundation for the
theory of functions.

In the fall of 1936, two years after Richard Courant’s arrival in the United States,
Bella Manel began her studies at New York University and served as receptionist
and secretary for Courant. Constance Reid, in her biography of Courant, quotes
Manel as recalling, “After I gave my ﬁrst report in the seminar, his attitude toward
me changed completely. I was accepted then and asked to lunch with him and the
other students” (p. 188). In the spring of 1937 Manel received a Blumenthal fellow-
ship and was able to give up her secretarial position with Courant. She held the
fellowship for two years and wrote her dissertation under the direction of Courant
on an aspect of Plateau’s problem, a problem with which he had been involved for
a number of years. She received her PhD in 1939 with a physics minor.

On March 6, 1938, Bella Manel married Max Shiﬀman (1914–2000), a fellow
student of Courant. Shiﬀman was born in New York City and earned a bachelor’s
degree and a master’s degree from City College of New York before receiving his
PhD from NYU in 1938. He then served as instructor in the evening session at City
College 1938–39 and as instructor at City College until 1942. During this period
Bella Shiﬀman published her dissertation and a related paper, both under the name
Bella Manel. The related paper was coauthored with Courant and her husband. The
Shiﬀman’s ﬁrst child, Bernard, was born in June 1942.

During World War II and for a period thereafter, Max Shiﬀman was a research
mathematician mainly working for the Applied Mathematics Panel of the Oﬃce of
Scientiﬁc Research and Development at New York University. The Shiﬀman’s sec-
ond child, David, was born in November 1945. In 1946 Max Shiﬀman was appointed
associate professor at New York University. He was then hired as full professor at
Stanford University in 1948. According to the 2003 obituary by Peter Lax, Max
Shiﬀman suﬀered the ﬁrst of two schizophrenic breakdowns in 1951, with a second
occurring in 1956.

In 1954 Bella Shiﬀman joined the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation (later TRW
Inc.) in Hawthorne, California, south of Los Angeles. She described some of her
responsibilities on the curriculum vitae prepared after her retirement. From 1954

to 1956 she “hired, trained and supervised a desk calculator section [that] performed
all the space technology computations for the newly formed company before the
digital computer was installed. [Her] group then acted as an adjunct to the computer
center.” From 1956 to 1958 she “worked with the designers of special purpose digital
computers by doing the experimental programming during the design stages and by
devising the machine language. [She] developed a method of programming the RW–
30 airborne computer which did not have random access memory. [She] developed
a testing technique for checking out the RW–300 computer as well as devising the
machine language for this desk size digital computer.” She and Max Shiﬀman were
divorced in February 1957.

On June 8, 1958, Bella Manel Shiﬀman married Emanuel Kotkin. Kotkin, a
widower, was born in 1897 in London, England, and immigrated to the United
States in his late teens. He was the president of a manufacturing plant at the time
of their marriage. According to his family, Emanuel Kotkin had no middle name
but often used “E” as a middle initial for business purposes. He used the name
Emanuel Ernest Kotkin on his World War I draft registration card.

From 1959 to 1965 Bella Kotkin worked for the Rand Corporation in Santa Mon-
ica, California, as mathematician on the professional staﬀ and later as consultant.
She worked closely with Richard Bellman, and together they, along with others,
produced a number of papers and technical reports; the technical reports included
both research papers and working papers, which were called research memoranda.
Bella Kotkin “worked on applications of mathematics and computers to medicine,
[which] involved simulating biological experiments by computer solutions of math-
ematical models of cancer chemotherapy and other biological systems” (Greenﬁeld
curriculum vitae). Her work continued to be cited into the 1990s.

After 1965 she “took time out from her professional career to spend time with
[her] husband, who was recovering from serious surgery, and to spend time with
[her] ailing mother. During this period [she] spent a few years doing volunteer
work, sometimes full time, in the area of human relations. Finally, the terminal
nature of [her] husband’s cancer condition prompted [them] to move to northern
California near Stanford” (Greenﬁeld curriculum vitae). During the academic year
1980–81 she was professor of mathematics and acting chairman of the department
at the College of Notre Dame in Belmont, north of Palo Alto.

Emanuel Kotkin died May 31, 1981, and Bella Kotkin returned to Los Angeles
that year. During 1982–84 she taught part time in the mathematics department
at the University of California, Los Angeles. On September 17, 1984, she married
Moses A. Greenﬁeld, a medical physicist whose wife had died two years earlier. He
was professor emeritus in the Department of Radiological Sciences of the School of
Medicine at UCLA. Moses Greenﬁeld was born in 1915 in New York City, earned a
bachelor’s degree from the City College of New York, and earned a master’s degree
in 1937 and a PhD in 1941 from New York University. He served as director of the
biomedical physics graduate program at UCLA from 1960 until his retirement in
1982 and again during 1992–95. After her own retirement, Bella Greenﬁeld devoted
herself to music as a classical pianist and to her family.

In 1995 Moses Greenﬁeld established the Bella Manel Prize for outstanding grad-
uate work by a woman or other member of an under-represented group at the
Courant Institute at New York University. Bella and Moses Greenﬁeld lived in Los

Angeles until 2007, when they moved to Baltimore, where her son Bernard Shiﬀ-
man was professor of mathematics at Johns Hopkins University. In 2010 Bernard
Shiﬀman informed the authors that Moses Greenﬁeld had developed Alzheimer’s
disease several years earlier and that his mother had cared for her husband until
July 2009, when it became too diﬃcult for her. Bella Greenﬁeld died on April 3,
2010, at age ninety-four and was buried in the Baltimore Hebrew Cemetery. She
was survived by her husband, children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.
