HOWE, Anna M. October 24, 1883–August 8, 1976.
Wells College (BA 1908), Cornell University (MA 1911, PhD 1917).

Anna Mayme Howe was born in Jordan, New York, the second of two children
of Eleanor Caldwell (Reed) (1855–1943) and Lewis B. Howe (1852–1928), natives
of New York. At the time of the 1900 census the family lived in Auburn, in upper
New York State; her parents had been married twenty-one years; and her father’s
occupation was listed as city missionary. A 1900 Auburn city directory lists Lewis
B. Howe as superintendent of the Gospel Knowledge and Mission Union; a 1917
directory of Onondaga County lists him as a farmer in Jordan, New York. Her
older brother, Raymond R. (1882–1953), graduated from Yale University in 1905.
Anna Mayme Howe graduated from the high school in Auburn, New York, in
1902, having taken the Latin-scientiﬁc course. When she entered nearby Wells Col-
lege in 1904, shortly before she turned twenty-one, she was one of ﬁfty-nine entering
freshmen. The tuition was $100 per year, and the board, consisting of “furnished
room, light, heat, and the washing of one dozen plain pieces weekly” was $300
(Wells College catalogue 1904–05). While Howe was at Wells, the mathematics pro-
fessor was Anna Lavinia Van Benschoten, who received her doctorate from Cornell
in 1908, having taken a leave of absence from Wells during Howe’s junior year,
1906–07. Howe graduated in 1908, at age twenty-four, and taught mathematics the
next two years.

Howe studied at Cornell 1910–11 and received her master’s degree in 1911 with a
major in mathematics and a minor in education. She then became head of the math-
ematics department at Fairmont Seminary, a school for girls in Washington, D.C.,
that is now closed. She indicated later that she was teaching both high school and
college work while there. She remained at Fairmont until 1915, when she returned
to Cornell with a graduate scholarship in order to work toward her doctorate. She
wrote her dissertation with Virgil Snyder in algebraic geometry, had a minor in
mathematical analysis, and took courses in physics. Her dissertation appeared in
1919 in the American Journal of Mathematics and was cited a number of times by
a fellow Cornell student, Temple Rice Hollcroft, who was professor at Wells College
1918–54. Howe received her doctorate in September 1917 and returned to Fairmont
to teach for an additional year.

It appears that the following year, 1918–19, Howe was overseer of technical ship-
ments for W. R. Grace and Company in New York. In the fall of 1919, she became a
teacher of mathematics at Dana Hall, Wellesley, a girls’ preparatory school founded
in 1881 to address the needs of early Wellesley College students requiring addi-
tional preparation. The following May, in response to a letter about an opening,
Howe wrote to the dean of H. Sophie Newcomb College, Tulane University, in New
Orleans, about a teaching position in the mathematics department there. Details of
her subsequent hiring and employment at the college appear in letters cited below
that are in the Tulane University Archives. In her letter of May 3, 1920, to Dr.
Pierce Butler, Howe wrote that her “present salary began last October with $1400
plus all living expenses but this was increased for the last four months at the rate of
$50/month. . . . Miss Cooke, the Principal of Dana Hall requests me to remain here
but I much prefer college work in Mathematics.” A letter of recommendation of
May 17, 1920, from Gertrude E. Preston, the head of the mathematics department
at Dana Hall, to Butler notes that Howe “has done excellent work in Dana Hall. . . .

You will ﬁnd her an earnest young woman, of scholarly attainments and a winning
personality. Her ideals, both as scholar and teacher, are high.” Howe accepted the
oﬀer of an instructorship for $1500 with board and lodging in the college residence
(folder: Howe, Anna M., Tulane University Archives).

Howe was on the faculty at Newcomb until 1930: as instructor 1920–21 and as
assistant professor 1921–30. She attended the International Mathematical Congress
in Toronto in 1924 and afterwards reported on bookstores at various women’s col-
leges in the East, apparently a task she had been assigned by her college dean before
Newcomb established its own bookstore. In 1925–26, Howe received an extra $300
stipend to serve as ﬁnancial secretary in charge of bookkeeping and ﬁnances for a
new Club Dormitory. The ﬁrst year ended with ﬁnancial success and satisﬁed stu-
dents, but Howe was told she must make diﬀerent arrangements for 1926–27. She
was to receive room and board but no extra stipend because there were no extra
duties. Howe was elected to the graduate school faculty in 1926 and planned to give
a course in projective geometry, “exactly as it has been given by Miss Spencer”
according to her dean’s recommendation to the graduate dean. Mary Cass Spencer,
MS, had been professor at Newcomb since the turn of the century.

In March 1927, Howe had to return home to New York State because of her
father’s illness. In a letter of June 24, 1928, Howe explained to the dean that she and
her mother would be occupying two rooms and eating “in the cafeteria at faculty
rates or elsewhere.” In the same letter, Howe requested a raise for the following
year. She closed by thanking the dean for “trying to make next year ﬁnancially
possible for mother and me.”

On May 3, 1930, Howe submitted her resignation to the dean of Newcomb Col-
lege. A letter of recommendation of February 18, 1931, from Dean Butler to Florence
Lewis at Goucher notes, “I do not hesitate to tell you that the real reason for Miss
Howe’s leaving Newcomb was only her own dissatisfaction in that she was not con-
sidered suitable for promotion to the head of the department upon the retirement
of Miss Spencer. It was felt that she did not have the necessary personal force,
or the necessary health for such position. Miss Howe, quite naturally, was disap-
pointed, and resigned her position. We should have continued her in the position
she had been ﬁlling satisfactorily.” When Howe left in 1930, she was replaced by
Marie Weiss.

In 1930, Howe and her widowed mother moved back to Jordan, New York, and
Howe sought employment in the area. While her work history at this time is some-
what unclear, it appears that Howe found a position about forty miles away at the
new Cazenovia Central School in the early 1930s. She indicated in 1937 that she
was head of the department at Cazenovia Central School and that she had been
supervisor of mathematics in Cazenovia, New York, since 1930. Elsewhere, she re-
ported that she was head of the department in schools in New York from 1931 to
1948. In May 1942, the former Cazenovia Seminary closed, and the school became
Cazenovia Junior College. At that time, Howe became professor and head of the
department at the college (now Cazenovia College). She remained there until 1957.
Howe was involved in a number of professional and non-professional activities.
She became a charter member of the MAA at the time of its founding in 1915, the
year she returned to graduate school to complete her doctoral studies. Throughout
her career she attended many national and sectional meetings; the last was a na-
tional summer meeting held at Cornell in 1965 celebrating the ﬁftieth anniversary

of the founding of the MAA. In 1928 she was treasurer for the New Orleans Con-
vention of the AAUW, which met at a local hotel April 9–12. In the late 1930s, she
reported that she was president of the local county mathematics club, and that she
was organizing a three-year course in mathematics (subvocational) for non-college
entrance students. At that time she was also a member of a literary society, and she
described her interests as traveling, music, and gardening. In the mid-1950s, she
reported her professional interests as teaching methods and educational statistics,
and noted that she had been a member of the National Education Association.

According to her obituary, Howe was founder and former president of the Madi-
son County Mathematics Association. She was a member of the New York Mathe-
matics Teachers Association; the American Association of Junior Colleges; Zeta Tau
Alpha, a national social sorority; Phi Theta Kappa, an honorary fraternity for men
and women in two year college education; Daughters of the American Revolution;
the League of Women Voters; and the New York State Citizens Council.

Howe moved back to Jordan after her years at Cazenovia. After her return she
was a member of the Jordan Study Club, the Jordan Historical Society, and the
Jordan Community Council as well as the First Church of Christ, Scientist, of
Syracuse. Anna Howe died in 1976 at age ninety-two in a nursing home in Auburn,
New York, and was survived by two nephews and a niece. She is buried in Maple
Grove Cemetery of nearby Jordan, along with her parents, brother, and sister-in-
law. The Howe Mathematics Award at Cazenovia College is given to a student
with the highest average who has also demonstrated originality and deep interest
in mathematics.
