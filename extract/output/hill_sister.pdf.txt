Maria Anna Hill was born in Koerth, Texas, the ﬁrst of two surviving daughters
of Mary Bradley (Watson) (1866–1922), born in Georgia, and Thomas James Hill
(1863–1936), from Texas. Her father had been married previously and had three
sons with his ﬁrst wife. At that time, he was in the livestock business. After his
ﬁrst wife died in 1891, he attended medical school in Louisville, Kentucky, settled
in Seguin, Texas, and in 1893 moved to Koerth and married Mary Bradley Watson.
He practiced medicine and continued in the stock business. Their other surviving
daughter, Catherine Jane, was born in 1905. In 1912 the family moved to Yoakum,
Texas, where Thomas Hill practiced medicine. His second wife died in 1922, and he
remarried in 1923.

Maria Hill started her schooling at age four in a public school before attending,
after one year, the Sacred Heart School in Hallettsville, near Koerth, and in 1913–
14 the St. Joseph School in Yoakum, where she was taught by the Sisters of Divine
Providence. She entered the convent of the Congregation of Divine Providence
(CDP) in San Antonio in 1914, at age ﬁfteen, and made her ﬁrst profession in 1916.
During the years 1916–22, Sister Mary Laetitia Hill taught and completed the
work for her bachelor’s degree. She ﬁrst taught at St. Mary’s School in San Antonio;
while there she taught high school, ﬁfth grade, and kindergarten in the years 1916–
21; in second semester 1920–21, she taught in Our Lady of the Lake high school.
She taught at the Holy Family School in Tulsa, Oklahoma, from 1921 to 1925. In
the meantime, she received her bachelor’s degree in 1922 from Our Lady of the Lake
College (now Our Lady of the Lake University of San Antonio). In 1925–26, she
studied at the Catholic University of American and received her master’s degree in
1926.

Sister Mary Laetitia Hill taught at Our Lady of the Lake College, established by
the Sisters of Divine Providence, for forty-one years: as instructor 1926–32 and as
professor 1935–70. The ﬁrst six years she taught both mathematics and physics. In
1932–35 she was at Catholic University studying for her doctorate in mathematics.
While there she wrote her dissertation in algebraic geometry and received her PhD
in 1935 with ﬁrst minor physics and second minor mechanical engineering. Starting
around the time she received her doctorate, Sister Mary Laetitia joined several
professional organizations: the AMS in 1935, the American Association of Physics
Teachers in 1936, and the American Physical Society in 1937. She also became a
member of the Texas Academy of Science and later joined the MAA and NCTM.
For nearly twenty-ﬁve years, starting in summer 1935, Sister Laetitia taught
mathematics or physics or both during the school year and in most summer sessions.
In addition to her teaching at Our Lady of the Lake College, she also directed an
NSF-sponsored summer institute for high school teachers at the college for six weeks
in 1959. She then received an NSF grant to participate for eight weeks in 1962 in a
summer institute for college teachers of mathematics at Bowdoin College in Maine.
After Sister Laetitia retired from Our Lady of the Lake College in 1969, she
worked in the college accounting oﬃce as a keypuncher until 1972. In 1972 she
retired to the convent and Regan Hall for retired sisters. In July 1974 she came out

Mexico, for one semester before returning to San Antonio. In August 1975 she
joined the CDP community in Tuba City, Arizona, and remained for three years.

Sister Laetitia was a serious bird watcher, who was known to abandon class
brieﬂy, telescope in hand, if she spotted a particularly interesting bird out the
window. She taught herself Spanish; shorthand; and to play the organ, ﬂute, and
violin; and was reported to have memorized all of Shakespeare’s sonnets.

Sister Laetitia ﬁnally retired in 1979. She died at age ninety-three in McCullough
Hall, the intensive care nursing facility of Our Lady of the Lake Convent in San
Antonio, in 1992. She was buried in Providence Cemetery at the convent.
