RUSSELL, Helen G. September 28, 1901–October 24, 1968.
Wellesley College (BA 1921), Columbia University (Teachers College) (MA
1924), Radcliffe College (PhD 1932).

Helen Gertrude Russell was born in Gorham, Maine, the third of six children of
Winifred Parker (Stone) (1869–1970) of Bucksport, Maine, and Walter Earle Russell
(1869–1948) of Fayette, Maine. Her mother graduated from Maine Wesleyan Female
College in Kent’s Hill and taught at Bridgton Academy in North Bridgton, Maine,
and at Miss Porter’s School in Farmington, Connecticut, before her marriage in
1896. Her father, a graduate of Wesleyan University, was a faculty member and,
for thirty-ﬁve years, principal of the Gorham Normal School, a predecessor of the
University of Southern Maine. Her parents had three sons: Earl Stone (1897–1973),
Willis Cleaves (1898–1986), and Robert Edward (b. 1906); their two other daughters
were Muriel Lincoln, who was born in December 1904 and died in June 1905, and
Celia Asenath (1909–1995). Her two older brothers both received PhDs: Earle in
education from Yale in 1934 and Willis in history from American University in 1932.
It was reported in a genealogy published in 1926 that Robert was in the Wesleyan
class of 1927 and that Celia was in the Wellesley class of 1929.

Helen Russell attended Gorham schools before entering Wellesley College. After
her college graduation in 1921, she taught mathematics and Latin in the high school
in Mt. Holly, New Jersey, 1921–23, and mathematics in the Horace Mann School
for Girls in New York City 1923–27. She earned a master’s degree from Teachers
College, Columbia, in 1924. For two issues of the 1924 Mathematics Teacher, the
sections on mathematics clubs were prepared by Russell and four other members
of David Eugene Smith’s 1923–24 Teachers College class in teaching mathematics
in secondary schools.

Russell returned to Massachusetts in 1927 to continue her graduate work at
Radcliﬀe College. She was also an instructor at Wellesley 1928–29. In a February
1930 letter to David Eugene Smith regarding a reference for a Radcliﬀe scholarship,
Russell wrote from Cambridge, “Three years ago I left Horace Mann School to come
here to do graduate work in mathematics. Last year I taught two freshman classes
at Wellesley and consequently did very little work at Radcliﬀe. This year I am
again doing full time work” (Professional Correspondence, David Eugene Smith
Professional Collection, Archival Collections, Rare Book and Manuscript Library,
Columbia University Libraries). She completed her work at Radcliﬀe in 1932. Her
dissertation in analysis was directed by J. L. Walsh, and a paper she coauthored
with him bearing the title of her dissertation appeared the following year in the
Transactions of the AMS. Her collaboration with Walsh, who had received his
doctorate from Harvard a dozen years earlier and spent most of his career as a
faculty member there, continued for more than thirty years.

Russell again joined the mathematics department at Wellesley in 1932, the year
Helen Abbot Merrill retired after nearly forty years on the faculty, the last sixteen
as department chairman. Russell remained at Wellesley for the rest of her career
except for leaves. She was instructor 1932–36, assistant professor 1936–45, associate
professor 1945–51, professor 1951–66, and emeritus professor after her retirement
in 1966. She was also named chairman in 1952 and the Helen Day Gould professor
of mathematics in 1955; she held that professorship until her retirement.

While at Wellesley, Russell continued her research in complex analysis and con-
tributed research articles and reviews to journals. She took several leaves, possibly
all sabbaticals; the ﬁrst, in 1942–43, was at the University of California. Her next
three leaves were all at Harvard. The ﬁrst of these was during the ﬁrst semester
of 1949–50 when she worked at Widener Library and audited a course with Oscar
Zariski. Her next two leaves were in 1956–57 and in 1963–64. During her last leave
she was a research fellow in mathematics. After each of these leaves Russell pub-
lished a paper jointly with J. L. Walsh. The last of these papers appeared in 1966,
the year they both retired. This last joint paper was the second part of a paper
ﬁrst published by Walsh the previous year.

Russell was also an active participant in college committee work and other ex-
tracurricular activities. At various times she served on the board of admission and
on the administrative board. She was also a member of committees on scholarships;
student records; curriculum and instruction; the library; war activities; nominations;
reappointments, promotions and dismissals; and appointments. She participated in
the Shop Club, the Chapel Board, and the General Court, and was a class dean.

Her professional activities included serving on the council of the Association of
Teachers of Mathematics in New England and on a committee on summer institutes
for mathematics teachers. She was a member of the entertainment committee for
various meetings, including the International Mathematical Congress in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, in 1950. She was also on a committee on a cooperative Harvard plan
for the preparation of teachers.

Russell was a Radcliﬀe alumna member of Phi Beta Kappa and held oﬃces in the
Wellesley chapters of Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi, and AAUP. She was a Republican
and a Methodist. She was an enthusiastic traveler, whose trips included travel in
Europe in 1925 and 1927, in the western United States in the summers of 1937 and
1939, and in the Orient in 1963–64 with her mother who was then ninety-ﬁve.

Helen G. Russell died in 1968 at age sixty-seven in Portland, Maine, after a brief
illness. She was survived by her mother, three brothers, and her sister, and is buried
in Eastern Cemetery in Gorham.
