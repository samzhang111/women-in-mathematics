ANDERSON, Mae Ruth. May 31, 1899–March 28, 1948.
Concordia College (BA 1920), University of Chicago (MA 1923, PhD 1936).

Mae Ruth Anderson was born near Westby, Wisconsin, the daughter of Ida
(Berg) (1862–1942) and Norton Alfred Anderson (1862–1930), both natives of Wis-
consin of Norwegian ancestry. Her parents married in about 1894; it was a second
marriage for Ida Anderson and a ﬁrst for Norton Anderson. In 1900 Ida Anderson
had two surviving children of three born; her son from her ﬁrst marriage was born in
1887 in South Dakota and was living with the family in Vernon County, Wisconsin,
in 1900 but not in later census years. Norton Anderson was a merchant.

Sometime after 1910 Mae Ruth Anderson and her parents moved to Shelly in
western Minnesota, where her father again owned a store. Anderson graduated from
high school in Halstad, Minnesota, a few miles from Shelly, in 1916 before entering
Concordia College in neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota.

When Anderson was at Concordia, 1916–20, the mathematics department con-
sisted of two faculty members, one of whom was Martha Brennun, who in 1917 was
the ﬁrst woman to receive a bachelor’s degree from Concordia. Brennun, a mathe-
matics major, had started teaching immediately after her graduation. At Concordia,
Anderson was a member of the Alpha Society, Concordia’s major scholastic honor
society, and was on the staﬀ of the Crescent, the student newspaper. A fellow stu-
dent of Anderson’s was Ruth B. Rasmusen, who was at Concordia 1918–21 and
who received her PhD from Chicago in 1936, as did Anderson.

After her graduation from Concordia in 1920, Anderson taught in high school in
Gayville, South Dakota, for a year before beginning her master’s work in mathemat-
ics at the University of Chicago in the fall of 1921. After six consecutive quarters,
she received the MA in March 1923. She taught at Waldorf Junior College and
Academy in Forest City, Iowa, from 1923 to 1928 and joined the faculty at Concor-
dia College as instructor in 1928. She was promoted to assistant professor in 1929.
While on the faculty at Concordia she resumed her graduate work at the University
of Chicago by attending the summer quarters in 1929, 1932, 1934, and 1935. A leave
of absence from Concordia College permitted her to be in residence at Chicago to
ﬁnish her doctoral work from summer 1935 to summer 1936. Her replacement at
Concordia that year was Emma Olson, a 1932 Chicago PhD recipient.

In 1937 Anderson was promoted from assistant to full professor and became head
of the mathematics department at Concordia, positions she retained until her death.
In addition to teaching mathematics, she taught some French and was noted for
her tireless eﬀorts to help students. Excerpts from Concordia College yearbooks of
1946 and 1947 convey a sense of her qualities: “Her obvious love of her subject, her
patience and sense of humor instill a lasting respect in her students.” “Her demands
for work, thoroughness, concentration, and more work bring results.” While at
Concordia, Anderson was also active on the graduate scholarship committee. During
World War II she was secretary of the Committee on Relations to the Armed Forces,
a committee that wrote to former students who were in the war.

Mae Ruth Anderson died of leukemia in a Rochester, Minnesota, hospital at
age forty-eight in 1948. Her bequest to the Trinity Lutheran Church in Moorhead
reﬂects her involvement with that church as oﬃcer of the Senior Sunday School and
active member of the Lutheran Daughters of the Reformation. Anderson’s mother,
who lived in Moorhead after being widowed, predeceased her in 1942. Anderson
