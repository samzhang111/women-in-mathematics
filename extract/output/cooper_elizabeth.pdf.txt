COOPER, Elizabeth M. January 19, 1891–May 17, 1967.
Radcliffe College (BA 1913), Bryn Mawr College (MA 1923), University of
Illinois (PhD 1930).

Elizabeth Morgan Cooper was born in Syracuse, New York, the eldest of six
children of Jessie Marian (Bagg) (1866–1933) and Henry R. Cooper (1856–1928).
Her mother, of Syracuse, and her father, of Woodbury, New Jersey, were married
in Syracuse in 1889 and had three daughters followed by three sons. They were
Elizabeth, Mary (1892–1983), Margaret (1895–1986), James (1896–1968), Joseph
(1900–1978), and Charles (1902–1987). It appears that all of the children later
graduated from either Radcliﬀe or Harvard. Her father was a Quaker and the man-
ager of the caustic soda department of the Solvay Process Company for more than
twenty years before his retirement in 1909. In 1910 he was described as a mechanical
engineer. Her parents were active in the social life of Syracuse.

Cooper attended the Orchard School and the Goodyear Burlingame School, both
private schools in Syracuse, before entering Radcliﬀe College in 1909, where she
held a scholarship all four years. She noted in her dissertation vita that she “was
privileged to have in most of her undergraduate work in mathematics, the patient,
inspiring instruction of Professor Charles Leonard Bouton.” She graduated magna
cum laude in mathematics from Radcliﬀe in 1913.

During the next seventeen years Cooper taught in private preparatory schools
and earned her graduate degrees. She ﬁrst taught at the Baldwin School in Bryn
Mawr, Pennsylvania, for fourteen years, 1913–1927. During 1920–23 she took grad-
uate courses at Bryn Mawr College and received a master’s degree in 1923, hav-
ing been a graduate scholar her last year there. During 1924–25 she had a leave
of absence from the Baldwin School and read mathematics at Newnham College,
Cambridge University, England, on a fellowship from Radcliﬀe College. While there
she studied with J. E. Littlewood, among others. She studied at Radcliﬀe College
1927–28. Cooper entered the University of Illinois in 1928, was an assistant 1929–
30, and wrote her dissertation in geometry before receiving her doctorate in 1930
with a minor in physics.

After receiving her PhD, Cooper continued to work in private schools for the
next seven years. She was principal of the Buckingham School in Cambridge, Mas-
sachusetts, from 1930 to 1935. In an obituary written for a school publication she
was described as the “principal of Buckingham during the depths of the Depres-
sion . . . [and] showed courage, clear-sighted practicality and humor, endearing her
to staﬀ and students alike.” She was head of the mathematics department of the
Chapin School in New York before becoming supervisor of mathematics and teacher
training at Hunter College and chairman of the mathematics department at Hunter
College High School in 1937. She remained chairman of the department at Hunter
High School until she retired in 1958. While at Chapin, Cooper wrote, but did not
publish, a textbook that she called “Algebra for Anne.” Later she worked on a
text called “Mathematics Made Plain” and on an article explaining some of her
philosophy of teaching called “Mathematics for the Bright Student.”

After her retirement Cooper returned to Syracuse, where she taught some under-
graduate mathematics courses at Syracuse University and participated in teacher
training seminars. The Buckingham obituary notes that after her retirement she
also served as “a devoted tutor in mathematics to privileged and underprivileged

children alike. She was very much interested in anything that would promote better
understanding among people of all races.” This attitude was in keeping with her
deep involvement with the Quakers. Among her contributions as a life member of
the American Friends Service Committee was her service as director in summer
1939 of Sky Island Hostel for European refugees at Nyack, New York. She was also
a a charter member and chairman of the management committee of a cooperative
residence club in New York, which she described in 1944 as a hostel for elderly
refugees. In 1948 it became Newark House of the New Jersey Fellowship Fund for
the Aged, and Cooper served as its president. She described herself as a Democrat
and was also active in the Radcliﬀe Club of Syracuse.

Elizabeth Cooper died in her home in Syracuse, New York, at age seventy-six in

1967. She was survived by her two sisters and three brothers.
