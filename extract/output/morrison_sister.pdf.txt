Rose Mary Morrison was born in Hyde Park, Massachusetts, in 1895, before the
community was annexed to Boston. She was the daughter of Mary Etta (Kennedy)
(1864–1929) of Rhode Island, and Charles F. Morrison (1862–1924) of Massachusetts.
At the time of the 1900 census, she was the youngest of three living children (of
four born). An older brother, John, was born in 1889, and a sister, Mary, in 1891.
In 1900 and 1910 her father was a grocer. By 1910 there were four living children
of ﬁve born, with a sister, Catharine, age six. Later information indicated that she
had two brothers, James K. and John M., and two sisters, Metta (Mary Etta) and
Catharine. In 1920 her father was a clerk for the city of Boston, and her brother
John was a lawyer. Rose Mary Morrison received her early education in parochial
and public schools of Boston and entered the Congregation of the Sisters of Charity
of Nazareth, Kentucky, in September 1916, at age twenty-one.

After making her vows, Sister Charles Mary was a high school teacher at Pre-
sentation Academy, Louisville, 1918–21. She was in residence at Fordham Univer-
sity from June 1921 to August 1922, when she received her BA degree. She then
taught Latin, Greek, mathematics, and German at Nazareth College, the Louisville
women’s college opened by the Sisters of Charity in 1920. In 1925 she received an
MA from Fordham and returned to Nazareth College to teach mathematics.

From 1928 to 1931 Sister Charles Mary was in residence at the Catholic Uni-
versity of America. She was one of four students who wrote their dissertations in
algebraic geometry under the direction of Aubrey E. Landry and received the PhD
in 1931. The others were Sister Leonarda Burke, Sister Mary de Lellis Gough, and
Sister Mary Felice Vaudreuil. Sister Charles Mary’s degree was awarded with minors
in philosophy and physics.

In 1931 Sister Charles Mary returned to Nazareth College, where she remained
until August 1950. She was joined in the mathematics department there by Sister
Mary Charlotte Fowler in 1937. While at Nazareth College, Sister Charles Mary
also served as head of the mathematics department, as registrar 1925–42, and as
dean after 1942. After her return to Nazareth and until she became dean, Sister
Charles Mary attended almost every meeting of the Kentucky Section of the MAA.
She presented three papers to the section, all in algebraic geometry. In 1934 she
was president of the Kentucky Association of Collegiate Registrars.

In 1950 Sister Charles Mary moved to Massachusetts, where she joined the fac-
ulty of Archbishop Williams High School in Braintree and served as archdiocesan
superintendent for Community High School. She died suddenly at the Carney Hos-
pital in Boston less than three years later as the result of a myocardial infarction; she
was ﬁfty-seven. Her remains were interred in the Nazareth Cemetery in Nazareth,
Kentucky. In August 1970 a residence hall at Spalding College, the coeducational
successor to Nazareth College that is now Spalding University, was named Morrison
Hall in her honor.
