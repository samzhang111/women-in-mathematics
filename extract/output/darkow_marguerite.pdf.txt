DARKOW, Marguerite D. November 12, 1893–December 9, 1992.
Bryn Mawr College (BA 1915), University of Chicago (MA 1923, PhD 1924).

Marguerite Daisy Darkow was the second of three daughters of Flora (Singer)
(1867–1942) and Martin Darkow (1856–1928). Her mother, born in Vienna, studied
in private schools there; she learned German, French, English, a little Italian, and
studied piano from a well-known teacher there. Martin Darkow was born in Riga,
then in Russia. He studied violin as a boy and learned piano and organ. He attended
college in Vienna. Flora Singer and Martin Darkow were married in 1888, and their
ﬁrst daughter, Angela Charlotte (1889–1943), was born in Vienna. They immigrated
to the United States in about 1891, and Marguerite was born in Philadelphia two
years later. The youngest daughter, Felice Evelyn (1898–1989), was also born in
Philadelphia. Martin Darkow’s occupation was listed as doctor in 1900, newspaper
editor in 1910, and music teacher in 1920. Both Flora and Martin Darkow taught
piano, but for the most part, he earned his living as a music and theatre critic for
a German language newspaper.

In the mid-1910s, Martin Darkow was managing editor of a socialist German-
language newspaper, the Philadelphia Tageblatt, that reported the war news from
a German perspective. In September 1917 he, along with others connected with the
newspaper, was indicted and tried for treason and for violation of the Espionage
Act for making false statements to help the enemy. These charges were based on
articles and editorials that appeared after the United States had declared war on
Germany in early April 1917. In 1918 Darkow was acquitted on the treason charge
but was convicted on the other charges. He received a ﬁve-year sentence that he
appealed. Even though the Supreme Court upheld the conviction in March 1920,
Darkow was never imprisoned and was pardoned by President Woodrow Wilson in
June that year.

All three daughters earned higher degrees. Angela Darkow earned a BA in 1911,
an MA in 1912, and a PhD in Greek literature in 1914 from Bryn Mawr. She
taught Greek and Latin for several years in private high schools, later worked as
an actuary, made and sold jam and ﬁne embroideries during the Depression, was
a bookkeeper, worked temporarily for the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, and died
of cancer after a long illness. Felice E. Darkow received her BA in 1920 from the
University of Pennsylvania and her LLB from the law school there. She had a variety
of positions; the last two decades of her career she was with the US Department
of Labor, ﬁrst in Philadelphia and then in Washington, D.C. She was given the
Distinguished Service Award upon her retirement.

Marguerite Darkow attended the E. Spencer Miller School in Philadelphia 1899–
1907 and the Philadelphia High School for Girls 1907–11 before entering Bryn Mawr
College in 1911. During her four years at Bryn Mawr she held several scholarships.
She was First Bryn Mawr Matriculation Scholar for Pennsylvania and the Southern
States 1911–12, Simon Muir scholar 1911–15, James E. Rhoads junior scholar 1913–
14, and Maria L. Eastman Brooke Hall memorial scholar 1914–15. She graduated in
mathematics and physics in 1915 and led the list of honor students. As the student
with the highest average, Darkow was awarded a Bryn Mawr European fellowship
for 1915–16; a Philadelphia newspaper reported that she had attained the highest
average of any Bryn Mawr student since 1900. Her mother’s cousin, the philosopher

Edmund Husserl, was then at G¨ottingen and encouraged her to come there to study,
but she delayed using the fellowship because of the war in Europe.

In 1915–16 Darkow taught mathematics and science at Tudor Hall, a private
school for girls in Indianapolis. During the summer of 1916 she studied at the
University of Pennsylvania before entering the Johns Hopkins University that fall.
She was a graduate student and fellowship holder in physics and mathematics 1916–
17, during which she had courses in higher geometry, theory of functions, and
theory of mechanics of physical optics. In the summer of 1917, she did statistical
work for the children’s bureau of the US Department of Labor. In 1917–18 she
returned to teaching mathematics and science, this time at Rogers Hall in Lowell,
Massachusetts, and the following year, 1918–19, she did astronomical research at
the Leander McCormick Observatory at the University of Virginia. During several
summers she worked as both a private tutor and as a tutor for fall college entrance
exams at tutoring camps in New England. From 1917, and continuing into the
1920s, Darkow’s father was often mentioned in the news making it diﬃcult for her
to pursue a normal career. On April 20, 1917, a few weeks after the United States
entered the war against Germany, M. Carey Thomas, president of Bryn Mawr,
wrote to Charlotte Scott, head of the mathematics department:

I should not be willing to nominate Miss Darkow for any position in
Bryn Mawr College. . . . I am particularly anxious that the question
should not be brought up as I think that it might hurt her future
career as a teacher. I should also not be willing for her to correct
examination papers. I do not wish to bring her into connection
in any way with Bryn Mawr College. (M. Carey Thomas Papers,
microﬁlm reel 137, LXII, 138)

Although Thomas does not explain the reasons behind her attitude toward Darkow,
the proximity of Bryn Mawr to Philadelphia would have made it likely that Thomas
was already aware of the writing that later led to Martin Darkow’s indictment
for treason. Furthermore, other of Thomas’s oﬃcial papers of the time have been
described as including “her eﬀorts to assure that German propaganda be banned
from the [Bryn Mawr] campus” (M. Carey Thomas Papers Guide and Microﬁlm
Edition, Reel 137: M. Carey Thomas Oﬃcial Papers; Letterbook no. 62. February
17, 1917 - January 3, 1918).

In 1920 Darkow was living in her parents’ home in Philadelphia. She began
working in the actuarial department of the Provident Life Insurance Company in
Philadelphia in 1919 or 1920 and passed section A, part I, of the Actuarial Society of
America examinations in May 1920. She passed part II of the associate examination
in May 1921 and part III in May 1922.

Darkow left her position at Provident in 1922 to enter graduate school at the
University of Chicago with a fellowship. She earned her master’s degree in 1923
and continued another year at Chicago with a fellowship. She received her PhD
in August 1924 with a dissertation written under the direction of L. E. Dickson.
The results in her dissertation and in her 1927 paper in the Annals of Mathematics
were cited in papers through at least 1940. In 1924–25, she traveled in Europe and
ﬁnally used the European fellowship awarded by Bryn Mawr in 1915 to study at
the Sorbonne in Paris. During this trip she visited Edmund Husserl, who was then
at Freiberg and who again urged her to go to G¨ottingen.

Darkow was appointed assistant professor at Indiana University in Bloomington
in 1925, and her appointment was terminated after two years. Correspondence
from the time reveals issues or misunderstandings. The university president wrote
that her appointment was originally a one-year appointment to replace a faculty
member on leave. Darkow responded that nothing in the original appointment letter
indicated that that was the case. She also noted that L. E. Dickson, her advisor at
Chicago, recommended at the time that she give up the National Research Council
fellowship to which she had been appointed and take the Indiana position instead,
and that he would not have done so for a one-year position. There is a further
question of whether a report to the president that she was a reader of the American
Mercury magazine and an admirer of H. L. Mencken contributed to the dismissal.
Darkow clearly felt that it had (President’s ﬁles, Indiana University Archives). In
any case, the following year, 1927–28, she was an instructor at Pennsylvania State
College.

In the fall of 1928 Darkow began her career at Hunter College in New York,
where she was instructor 1928–30, assistant professor 1928–42, associate professor
1942–56, professor 1956–59, and professor emeritus after her retirement in 1959.
She continued her study of mathematics at the University of Chicago in summer
1938 and studied statistics at the University of Michigan the following two sum-
mers. In June 1940 Darkow indicated in a letter to Helen Owens that she had “a
short paper, ‘Generalized Center-circles,’ in search of a publisher” (Owens Papers).
In that same letter, she also commented on women in mathematics noting that
women spend time on “minor domestic duties that certainly hamper their ener-
gies.” Nonetheless, she indicated that “if we exclude the ﬁrst-rate Mathematicians,
I believe we will ﬁnd many women who can compete with men in the second rank, as
teachers, statisticians, etc.” The following year Darkow and a colleague at Hunter,
Mary K. Landers, wrote a preliminary edition of a textbook they called Elementary
Mathematics. Darkow sometimes served as faculty advisor of the Hunter College
mathematics club and as director of the Hunter chapter of Pi Mu Epsilon.

Darkow was interested in bird watching, travel, ﬂowers, photography, reading,
and corresponding with friends. She knew Latin and Greek, read both German and
French with ease, and taught herself Spanish and a little Italian after her retirement.
She traveled frequently. She regularly contributed to charities and was a member
of the American Civil Liberties Union and various anti-nuclear organizations. In
1936 she hosted Edmund Husserl’s son, Gerhart, a law professor, and his son-in-
law, Jakob Rosenberg, an art historian, when they came to the United States to
escape from Nazi Germany. As established academics, both of these cousins had
jobs waiting for them. In March 1940, a Jewish cousin who was ﬂeeing Austria
without a job in the United States listed Darkow’s address as her destination on
the manifest of alien passengers arriving in the United States.

In about 1950, Darkow became close friends with Edna Sheinhart (1923–1995),
who had graduated from Hunter in the 1940s and was a research engineer. After
Darkow’s retirement they shared an apartment in New York, traveled together, and
then shared a home in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. Sheinhart had bought a
farm in Sheﬃeld, and the renovated barn became their permanent home in 1972.
Their last good trip was to Egypt in 1979. In about 1982 Darkow was diagnosed
with Alzheimer’s disease. She remained in her home and was cared for by Sheinhart

and a staﬀ of care givers. Marguerite Darkow died in her home in 1992. She was
ninety-nine. Her ashes were buried at the top of the hill on the premises.

A letter from Dorothy Garfein, a friend and executor of her estate, informing
Bryn Mawr of Darkow’s death, indicated that “as a tribute to her lifelong concern
for wildlife and the environment a 215 acre tract of farmland and woods was donated
in Marguerite’s name to the Massachusetts Audubon Society.” This gift formed the
basis of a wildlife sanctuary in Sheﬃeld, Massachusetts. It was ﬁrst called the Mount
Everett Wildlife Sanctuary but was opened to the public in 2007 as the Lime Kiln
Farm Wildlife Sanctuary.
