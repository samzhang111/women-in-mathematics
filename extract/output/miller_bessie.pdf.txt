MILLER, Bessie Irving. November 4, 1884–February 4, 1931.
Woman’s College of Baltimore (BA 1907), Johns Hopkins University (PhD
1914).

Bessie Irving Miller was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the only child of Bessie
(Knotts) (1864–1914) and Irving Miller (1858–1946), both natives of Maryland,
who married in 1882. Her father was a surgeon, and in 1900 the household on St.
Paul Street in Baltimore included four boarders, a cook, two house maids, and two
trained nurses in addition to the three family members.

Miller attended the Girls Latin School, the preparatory department for the
Woman’s College of Baltimore (Goucher College after 1910), which she then at-
tended and from which she graduated in 1907. According to Cockey’s “Mathemat-
ics at Goucher,” “mathematics was her second choice of interest, chosen when she
realized that poor eyesight would make it impossible for her to become a surgeon
. . . ” (p. 11). In 1903–07, while Miller was a student at Woman’s College of Bal-
timore, the mathematics department there consisted of William H. Maltbie, who
had earned his PhD from Johns Hopkins in 1895, and Clara Latimer Bacon, who
had earned an MA from the University of Chicago in 1904.

In 1907–08, the year following her graduation from college, Miller was a graduate
student in mathematics and physics at the University of Chicago with a fellowship
sponsored by the Woman’s College of Baltimore. In October 1908 she entered the
Johns Hopkins University as a graduate student in mathematics, astronomy, and
classical archaeology. This was just a year after Bacon, her college mathematics
instructor, entered Johns Hopkins when the trustees voted to allow women to be
admitted to graduate courses without special permission.

In 1911 Miller interrupted her graduate studies to become an instructor of math-
ematics at Kemper Hall in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Kemper Hall, closed in 1975, was
an Episcopal school for girls that had preparatory and collegiate departments when
Miller was there. Two years later she returned to Johns Hopkins and ﬁnished her
doctoral work as a university fellow during the year 1913–14. The notes she took
her ﬁnal year for a course on groups taught by Arthur B. Coble, together with
her own writings on elliptic functions, are preserved as the Bessie Irving Miller
Papers at Johns Hopkins. Miller passed written exams in mathematics, astronomy,
and classical archaeology and art, and wrote her dissertation in algebraic geometry
under the direction of Coble, who was an early student of Frank Morley at Johns
Hopkins. Miller was one of Coble’s ﬁrst two doctoral students. The letter of May 30,
1914, by Morley and Coble recommending the acceptance of her dissertation notes,
“She applies eﬀectively geometrical methods to an analytical problem, and obtains
results both novel and interesting. The style is good and gives clear evidence of a
well-balanced and mature mind” (Student folders, Ferdinand Hamburger Univer-
sity Archives, Johns Hopkins University). When Miller received her doctorate from
Johns Hopkins in 1914, she became the ﬁrst of ten Goucher graduates to obtain a
PhD in mathematics before 1940; seven of these were granted by Johns Hopkins.
Bacon had become the ﬁrst woman to receive a PhD in mathematics from Johns
Hopkins in 1911. Miller remained at Johns Hopkins the year after receiving her
doctorate and was later described as a research worker that year.

In 1915 Miller became head of the mathematics and physics departments at
Rockford College in Illinois, where she was to remain for thirteen years. Rockford

College, originally a female seminary, granted its ﬁrst degree (baccalaureate) in
1882 and remained a women’s college until 1958. Institutional changes in titles and
department structures over the years resulted in Miller’s later being professor of
mathematics and physics and then professor of mathematics. During her tenure
at Rockford, her primary department’s name was mathematics, then mathematics
and physics, and ﬁnally mathematics and astronomy. Through all these changes
Miller was usually the professor teaching the majority of the mathematics, physics,
and astronomy courses. By 1920 she was the most senior faculty member at the
college. For the year 1919–20 she was joined by associate professor Jessie M. Jacobs
(Oﬀermann), who had just earned her PhD at the University of Illinois. Jacobs was
also a student of Arthur B. Coble, who had moved to the University of Illinois in
1918 from Johns Hopkins. Jacobs remained one year at Rockford before moving to
the University of Texas as instructor of pure mathematics.

In addition to her regular teaching and administrative duties at Rockford, Miller
remained intellectually active in broader areas. She again studied at the University
of Chicago during the summer of 1920. During her years at Rockford, she greatly
expanded and broadened the course oﬀerings in mathematics and science. She in-
troduced courses in diﬀerential equations, history of mathematics, mathematical
drawing, statistics, projective geometry, applications of mathematics, philosophy of
mathematics, and theory of investments, as well as courses for teachers of mathe-
matics. At Rockford she introduced an elective course that covered a broad range of
topics in mathematics and science. Her 1924 book Romance in Science was based
on lectures developed for this course. Similar talks, with titles “The Fourth Di-
mension” and “The Einstein Theory” had also been given by Miller at meetings
of a student mathematics club that was begun two years after Miller’s arrival at
Rockford.

While Miller was at Rockford, she was especially active in the MAA. She was
a charter member of the MAA and was elected secretary of the Illinois Section
in May 1924. The following three years she was secretary-treasurer of the section.
In addition to talks she presented at MAA meetings, her interest in mathematics
education was evident in her participation in the section meetings, where she was
a discussant for talks given in 1919 on the training of mathematics teachers and in
1926 on undergraduate mathematics courses in geometry.

Miller had a leave of absence from Rockford College in the spring term 1927–
28. She then took a position as instructor at the University of Illinois in 1928. It
is unclear what prompted her move to Illinois after that leave. It is possible that
she was encouraged to come by Arthur B. Coble, her dissertation advisor, who
had spent 1927–28 back at Johns Hopkins before returning to Illinois. It is likely
that Miller had contact with Coble that year since in May 1928 she gave a talk
to the Maryland-District of Columbia-Virginia Section of the MAA. At Illinois,
she directed the master’s thesis of Josephine Chanler and possibly others. She also
published another research paper in her ﬁeld, the ﬁrst since her earlier work based
on her dissertation. In addition to her work in the mathematics department at
Illinois, Miller was involved in vocational guidance for women for the Woman’s
League, a University of Illinois organization for female students.

Miller played violin, attended movies, theater productions, and the symphony
(Cockey, 11). She was an Episcopalian. Miller’s eyesight became increasingly bad
during the 1920s, and she frequently used a scribe for her correspondence.

Bessie Irving Miller died at age forty-six on February 4, 1931, in Burnham Hos-
pital in Champaign as the result of a “strepticoccic [sic] infection of the throat and
mucous surfaces of head: nose ears etc” (Illinois death certiﬁcate). She had become
ill a few days earlier, and an operation to open the ear drums was performed on
February 3. Before her death she was living with Echo D. Pepper, a colleague at
Illinois. Miller was buried in Lorraine Cemetery just outside Baltimore. The Bessie
Irving Miller scholarship at Rockford College, ﬁrst given in 1950, provides the in-
come from $7,000 for a female mathematics major each year.
