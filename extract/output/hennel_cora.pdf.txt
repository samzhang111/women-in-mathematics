HENNEL, Cora B. January 21, 1886–June 26, 1947.
Indiana University (BA 1907, MA 1908, PhD 1912).

Cora Barbara Hennel was born in Evansville, Indiana, the second of three daugh-
ters of Anna M. (Thuman) (1854–1925), born in Indiana, and Joseph Hennel (1842–
1934), born in Ohio. Her parents married in 1882; it was a second marriage for her
father. In early years he was a teacher, served for three years on the Union side
in the Civil War, and later was in business. In 1900 three children (of ﬁve born)
were living: Cecilia Barbara, born in 1883; Cora Barbara, born in 1886; and Edith
Amelia, born in 1891. They lived on a farm near Evansville.

Cora Hennel and her older sister went to grade school together and both grad-
uated from Evansville (now Central) High School in 1901. They then taught in
country grade schools to save money for college and entered Indiana University in
Bloomington together in the fall of 1903. The following year they convinced their
parents and sister to move to Bloomington.

All three daughters received bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Indiana; Cora
and Cecilia received BA’s in 1907 and MA’s in 1908 (Cora in mathematics and
Cecilia in English), and Edith received a BA in 1911 and an MA in 1912 (both in
botany) and stayed an additional year as a teaching fellow. Cora was a member of
Mortar Board; all three were elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Both of Hennel’s sisters
were on the faculty at Indiana before their marriages; her older sister, Cecilia Hennel
Hendricks, returned to the English department in 1931 after homesteading with her
husband in Wyoming. She remained on the faculty until her retirement in 1953.

Cora Hennel continued her studies and began teaching at Indiana University
immediately after receiving her bachelor’s degree. She was a teaching fellow 1907–
09, earned her master’s degree in 1908, and was appointed instructor of mathematics
in August 1909. At the suggestion of Professor David Rothrock, she continued her
work toward the doctorate, and wrote her dissertation during the year 1911–12
under the direction of R. D. Carmichael. Carmichael received his PhD at Princeton
as a student of G. D. Birkhoﬀ in 1911 and was at Indiana brieﬂy before he moved to
the University of Illinois in 1915. Hennel’s diaries in the Indiana University Archives
describe her time as a student. Her entry of January 22, 1912, records, “Now as
for this term . . . the most remarkable thing is that I’m not teaching at all – just
studying.” On April 14 she wrote, “I’m simply cutting out everything this term
and working . . . thesis coming all right, but when I think of the cramming I’ll have
to do between now & June I feel desperate. Dr. C. has been very encouraging tho:
he told me the other day my knowledge of math is as broad as that of half the men
in the math faculty at Princeton. Gracious!” On June 9, after her examination, she
wrote, “Well, it’s over. And Dr. Carmichael said I passed a ‘brilliant examination.’ ”
Hennel’s PhD in June 1912 was the ﬁrst in mathematics and the ﬁrst to a woman
awarded by Indiana University. It was only the second doctorate in mathematics
granted in the state of Indiana, the ﬁrst having been awarded by Purdue to James
Byrnie Shaw in 1897.

Hennel continued to hold a faculty position at Indiana until her death. She re-
mained an instructor until 1916, was assistant professor 1916–23, associate professor
1923–36, and became professor in 1936. In about 1907 Hennel was instrumental in
helping to start the Euclidean Circle, a mathematics club for mathematics majors,
upperclassmen, graduate students, and faculty in the department. An article on

the Euclidean Circle in the winter 2006–07 department alumni newsletter notes the
topics of some presentations Hennel made to the club. In 1925 she and a colleague,
Harold T. Davis, produced notes that were used in a general mathematics course.
The notes were not published, but were bound and distributed by the bookstore.

Hennel was extremely active on the campus, serving, for example, as president
of the Indiana University chapters of AAUP, AAUW, the YWCA Board, the Corda
Fratres Association of Cosmopolitan Clubs (dedicated to fostering understanding
between foreign and American students), and the Women’s Faculty Club. She was
foreign student advisor, and, in 1920, was chairman of a committee on friendly
relations among foreign students. She chaperoned student events, was a member
of the university’s student aﬀairs committee, and was on the advisory board of
the Association of Women Students. She regularly participated in local, state, and
national meetings of mathematical and scientiﬁc organizations. She attended the
organizational meeting of the MAA at Ohio State University in December 1915 and
was vice chairman 1939–40 and chairman 1940–41 of the Indiana Section. She was
also chairman of the mathematics division of the Indiana Academy of Science for
1940, and she and her sister attended the Harvard Tercentenary Conference of Arts
and Sciences in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1936.

The obituary in the Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science records that
Hennel was “well known throughout the State, having addressed numerous Indiana
University alumni groups, and various educational, professional and civic organi-
zations” (p. 4). It notes further that “Dr. Hennel’s chief contributions were in her
excellent teaching and her inﬂuence on many students, both native and foreign. . . .
In her quiet and unobtrusive way she encouraged and helped many of them not
only through counseling but ﬁnancially as well” (p. 4). In 1995 the Indiana math-
ematics department named its faculty/student lounge the Cora B. Hennel Room;
the department also annually awards Cora B. Hennel memorial scholarships to out-
standing undergraduate majors.

Hennel’s main hobby was writing poetry, and some of her poems appeared in
various publications including The Columbia Anthology of Verse and School and
Society. She was aﬃliated with the First Methodist Church in Bloomington.

Cora Hennel had undergone major surgery several weeks before her death in
Bloomington in 1947 at age sixty-one of colon cancer. She was survived by her two
sisters, four nieces, and a nephew. She was cremated.
