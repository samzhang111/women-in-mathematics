COWLEY, Elizabeth B. May 22, 1874–April 13, 1945.
Indiana Normal School (BS 1893), Vassar College (BA 1901, MA 1902), Columbia
University (PhD 1908).

Elizabeth Buchanan Cowley was born in Allegheny (now part of Pittsburgh),
Pennsylvania, the eldest and by 1900 the only surviving child of ﬁve born to
Mary Junkin (Buchanan) (1853–1937) and John Cowley (b. 1843). Mary Junkin
Buchanan was born in Ohio; she attended public schools in Allegheny and the Pitts-
burgh Female College (now Chatham College), from which she received a Mistress
of English Literature [or Language] degree in 1870. On February 27, 1873, in Al-
legheny, Mary Buchanan married John Cowley of Pennsylvania. Mary B. Cowley
was a volunteer supervisor of playgrounds in Pittsburgh for most of the ﬁrst decade
of the century before being elected supervisor of playgrounds and vacation schools.
She was a member of the school board in Pittsburgh and was engaged in other civic
and cultural activities, some of which are indicated in her entry in Woman’s Who’s
Who in America 1914–1915. In 1900 John Cowley was an auditor; he was deceased
by 1914.

Elizabeth Cowley attended the public schools of Allegheny after which she stud-
ied for two years before receiving a BS degree in 1893 from Indiana Normal School
(now Indiana University of Pennsylvania). She taught for the next four years in
public schools in Pennsylvania and was given a life diploma by the state.

Cowley entered Vassar College in September 1897 and received her BA degree
four years later. She was awarded the graduate scholarship in mathematics and
astronomy for the next year and received her MA degree from Vassar in 1902.
Cowley remarked in the vita accompanying her later PhD dissertation, “Through
the courtesy of Professor [Mary W.] Whitney an opportunity was given to me to
work out the deﬁnitive orbit of a comet. Dr. [Caroline E.] Furness gave valuable
advice and Miss [Ida] Whiteside assisted in calculations.” The paper was published
as 1907d with Whiteside, a fellow graduate student, as coauthor. In 1940 Cowley
referred to it as a “Prize Paper” (Owens questionnaire).

In 1902 Cowley was appointed instructor in mathematics at Vassar and continued
at that rank until 1913. She attended the summer sessions at the University of
Chicago 1903–05, where she had twelve weeks of mathematics and physics each year.
She began work at Columbia University during the second semester of the academic
year 1905–06 and remained for summer school in 1906 and the next academic year,
1906–07. Her doctorate was awarded by Columbia in 1908. She wrote in the vita
accompanying the dissertation, “I desire to express my gratitude to all my teachers,
but especially to Professor Keyser, who is able in an unusual degree to inspire his
students with a hearty enthusiasm for study. To Professor Henry S. White, as head
of my department at Vassar College, I am indebted for encouragement, criticism,
and sympathy with my work.”

Cowley remained at Vassar, except for leaves of absence, until 1929. She was
assistant professor 1913–16 and associate professor 1916–29. While at Vassar she
continued her studies, was active in a number of mathematical societies, and pub-
lished regularly. She reported in 1914 that she had studied at the universities in
G¨ottingen and Munich as well as those indicated above. She attended the Interna-
tional Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) held at Cambridge, England, in 1912. She
belonged to two foreign mathematical societies and was a charter member of the

MAA. She was particularly active in the MAA during its ﬁrst decade. She served
on the program committee for the annual meeting at the University of Chicago in
1917 and was elected to the MAA council to serve January 1918–January 1921.
However, in 1920 the MAA incorporated and she automatically became a mem-
ber of the new board of trustees with a term ending in December 1920. She also
stood for election to vice president in 1921 and 1925. In addition to contributing
the articles and reviews indicated below, Cowley contributed to a number of other
educational and popular publications, writing on her 1940 questionnaire for Helen
Owens that she had published 100 articles. She also served on the editorial board
of the abstracting journal Revue semestrielle des publications math´ematiques and
was a regular reviewer for the journal from 1908 until 1926. Furthermore, among
the twenty-four book reviews she published in the Bulletin of the AMS, seventeen
were reviews of books written in French, German, Italian, or Spanish.

Cowley had a leave of absence from Vassar 1926–29 and was promoted to pro-
fessor while on leave. She resigned her position at Vassar in June 1929 to return to
Pittsburgh to be with her mother. She wrote in 1937 that she “came to do a special
piece of work” (Owens questionnaire). She immediately took a teaching position in
a Pittsburgh high school and continued teaching until 1938, near the time of her
mother’s death. She was active in local professional organizations: she was sponsor
for various activities of the Pittsburgh public high schools, she became president of
the mathematics section of the Pennsylvania State Education Association in 1934,
and she was for a time president of the Association of Teachers of Mathematics of
Western Pennsylvania.

Cowley’s mathematical interests were broad. During the 1920s she published
and spoke on historical topics. During that period she also studied crystallography
because she had read some work on phases of atomic structure that interested her.
Later her publications were more in the ﬁeld of mathematics education, and in
December 1934 she directed a symposium on “Methods of making mathematics
interesting” by Pittsburgh teachers at an NCTM meeting held in Pittsburgh at the
same time as the annual MAA meeting. She gave many invited talks at schools
and one to the Central Association of Science and Mathematics Teachers. In 1941
she wrote a book about public education in the United States as exempliﬁed by
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and California.

In her entry in the 1914 Woman’s Who’s Who of America, Cowley reported
that she was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution and of the
National Plant, Flower and Fruit Guild; that she was in favor of women’s suﬀrage;
and that she enjoyed outdoor sports. In 1940, after she had retired from teaching,
she indicated that she was traveling and writing, and that poetry that she had
written had been published.

At some time after her mother’s death and her own retirement from teaching
in Pittsburgh, Elizabeth Cowley moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. She suﬀered a
stroke in 1941 that left her unable to speak or use her right side. A newspaper item
in 1943 described how she had “overcome her handicap completely through her
indomitable spirit and strong determination to carry on.” It then described how,
with only her left hand, she was able to keep up her writing and correspondence,
embroider, weave, and sew; at the time of the article she had made seven large Red
Cross afghans to aid the war eﬀort. Elizabeth Cowley died in her residence in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida, at age seventy in 1945 and was cremated.
