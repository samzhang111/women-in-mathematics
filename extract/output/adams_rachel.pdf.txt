ADAMS, Rachel (Blodgett). October 13, 1894–January 22, 1982.
Wellesley College (BA 1916), Radcliffe College (MA 1919, PhD 1921).

Rachel Blodgett was born in Woburn, Massachusetts, the eldest of three children
of Mabel Edith (Owen) (b. 1874) and William Edward Blodgett (b. 1864), natives
of Massachusetts. Her parents did not attend college; her father was treasurer of
a company that manufactured tiles and was at one point mayor of Woburn. Her
brother, Malcolm, was born in 1897 and her sister, Hope, was born in 1903.

After attending public grammar school 1899–1908 and Woburn High School
1908–12, Rachel Blodgett entered Wellesley College, where several relatives of her
father had studied in the early years of the college. Blodgett majored in mathe-
matics and Latin, was a member of the Shakespeare Society, and played cornet in
the Wellesley College symphony orchestra. She was a Wellesley scholar 1914 and a
Durant scholar 1915.

Following her graduation from Wellesley in 1916, Rachel Blodgett attended Har-
vard summer school in 1916 and was employed 1916–18 as a teacher of mathematics
(mathematics mistress) at Miss Edgar’s and Miss Cramp’s School in Montreal, Que-
bec. The next three years she did graduate work in analysis at Radcliﬀe College,
where she held an Edward Austin scholarship at least two years and a Mary E.
Horton fellowship her last year, 1920–21. She earned her master’s degree in 1919
and her doctorate in 1921. While there she had her closest contact with Professors
W. F. Osgood and O. D. Kellogg, although it is not clear under whose direction
she wrote her dissertation. She was instructor of mathematics at Wellesley during
the academic year 1921–22.

Rachel Blodgett married Clarence Raymond Adams on August 17, 1922, in Eden
Park, Rhode Island. C. R. Adams was born on April 10, 1898, in Cranston, Rhode
Island. He was a 1918 graduate of Brown University, earned master’s degrees from
Brown and Harvard University, and completed his PhD in mathematics in 1922
under George David Birkhoﬀ at Harvard. The newly married couple were in Rome
and G¨ottingen 1922–23 while C. R. Adams was a Sheldon traveling fellow from
Harvard.

Upon their return in 1923 Rachel and C. R. Adams moved to Providence, Rhode
Island, where he was to spend his career in the mathematics department at Brown.
He became full professor in 1936 and served as department chair from 1942 to 1960.
He was active in a number of professional mathematical societies; in particular,
he served as councillor and vice president of the AMS and was on the board of
governors of the MAA. He was starred in American Men of Science in 1933. C. R.
Adams retired as professor emeritus from Brown in 1965 and died on October 15,
1965. There were no children of the marriage.

Rachel B. Adams was a member of the MAA for a year after her marriage and
served as a tutor at Radcliﬀe from 1926 to 1941. During these years the other
mathematics tutor at Radcliﬀe was Florence Curtis Graustein. At least through
the 1920s Adams continued her interest in integral equations. G. C. Evans of Rice
Institute used information from her dissertation in an extensive review of a book

on linear integral equations for the Monthly in 1927. She presented her results to
the AMS in 1926 and published them in the American Journal in 1929.

Rachel Adams was a Baptist and a Republican and was active in and served as an
oﬃcer of a number of community organizations, including the First Baptist Church
Women’s Society, the YWCA, the Brown Faculty Ladies, the Handicraft Club of
Providence, the Weavers Guild, the Providence Art Club, a literary society, an
amateur theatrical group, and the Rhode Island Wellesley Alumnae. During World
War II she was registered in Washington with the National Roster of Scientiﬁc
Personnel, although there is no evidence of her being asked to do scientiﬁc work
at that time. She was, however, engaged in other war-time work such as making
dressings.

During their marriage Rachel and C. R. Adams traveled extensively by auto-
mobile in the United States and Europe. After her husband’s death she continued
her community work and served as treasurer for several years and on the board of
directors of the Home for Aged Women (later the Tockwotton Home) in Providence.
Adams lived in her family home in Providence for more than forty years un-
til 1980, when she moved to the Tockwotton Home just over a year before her
death there at age eighty-seven in 1982. She was survived by her sister, Hope Blod-
gett Stebbins, and was buried in Swan Point Cemetery in Providence. Following
her death, a bequest from her estate was used to establish the Blodgett Fund at
Wellesley, with the income to be used for scholarships.
Organizational aﬃliations: AMS, MAA, Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi.
