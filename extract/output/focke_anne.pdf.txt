FOCKE, Anne (Bosworth). September 29, 1868–May 15, 1907.
Wellesley College (BS 1890), Georg-Augusts-Universit¨at G¨ottingen (PhD
1900).

Anne Lucy Bosworth was born in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, the only surviving
child of Ellen (Metcalf) (1843–1929) and Alfred Bosworth (b. ca. 1846), both from
Rhode Island. It appears that her mother was widowed some time in the early 1870s.
Mrs. Ellen Bosworth was working at the Harris Institute Library in Woonsocket in
1874; in 1880 she was described as a librarian, and she, her sister, and Anne were
living with Anne’s maternal grandmother in Woonsocket. In the early 1890s, Ellen
Bosworth and her sister were living at the same address.

After attending public schools in Woonsocket, Anne Bosworth entered Wellesley
College in 1886 and graduated in 1890, in the same class as Grace Andrews, Clara
Latimer Bacon, and the mother of Dorothy Kohlmetz.

Bosworth spent the two years after her graduation from Wellesley as a high
school teacher in Amesbury, Massachusetts, before moving, in 1892, to Rhode Island
College of Agricultural and Mechanical Arts (now University of Rhode Island) in
Kingston as professor of mathematics. It was in 1892 that the college ﬁrst oﬀered
instruction at the postsecondary level. During the summer quarters of 1894, 1896,
and 1897, she studied with E. H. Moore and Oskar Bolza at the University of
Chicago.

In April 1898, Anne Bosworth was granted a year’s leave from Rhode Island
College for study in G¨ottingen. That summer she attended Felix Klein’s lectures in
Mechanik, along with Emilie Norton Martin and Virginia Ragsdale, both graduates
of Bryn Mawr College, who had studied at G¨ottingen the previous winter as well.
While at G¨ottingen, Bosworth also heard lectures by Arthur Sch¨onﬂies, Issai Schur,
and Woldemar Voigt. In the winter semester 1898–99, Bosworth attended David
Hilbert’s lectures on Euclidean geometry; it was from these that she derived the
basis for her subsequent dissertation work. Her daughter recalled in 1978:

According to my grandmother, [my mother] had no plan for a doc-
torate – just a year’s study. . . .

In the spring she was “summoned” to tea with her professor,
& she dressed her best, gloves, hat & all. After a ceremonial tea,
her professor asked her when she expected to take her doctoral
examinations. She said she had not any such intention, had not
even thought of a dissertation topic! The professor said, “But your
dissertation is ﬁnished”(!). It appeared she had done a special ex-
ercise for him, and it was considered an entirely original approach
& acceptable as a thesis. So instead of spending her summer trav-
elling in Italy, Greece, etc. she remained at G¨ottingen & took her
exams & and passed with honor.

Bosworth took her oral examination on July 31, 1899, just over a year after she
had arrived in Germany, and, accompanied by her mother, returned to the United
States in August 1899. According to Renate Tobies, Hilbert assessed Bosworth’s dis-
sertation as “eine t¨uchtige und selbst¨andige Leistung von wissenschaftlichen Werte”
[a sound and independent achievement of scientiﬁc value] (our translation) (p. 136).
The PhD from G¨ottingen was awarded in 1900. She became a member of the AMS

at about that time. In 1901, G. B. Halsted referred to her dissertation in a sup-
plementary report to his bibliography on non-Euclidean geometry that was ﬁrst
published in 1878. He wrote that her dissertation “is a beautiful piece of non-
Euclidean geometry, and is, so far as I know, the ﬁrst feminine contribution to our
fascinating subject” (Amer. Math. Monthly 228, Science 715).

Bosworth then returned to Rhode Island College and remained for the next two
years, living with her mother in Kingston. While in G¨ottingen, however, she had
met Theodore Moses Focke, who studied mathematics and physics there 1896–98
and received his PhD in 1898. On August 7, 1901, they were married in Kingston,
Rhode Island. Theodore Focke was born on January 3, 1871, in Massillon, Ohio, and
was an 1892 graduate of the Case School of Applied Science (later Case Institute of
Technology, now Case Western Reserve University) in Cleveland. After his studies
abroad, he returned to Case Institute of Technology, where he was an instructor of
mathematics and civil engineering at the time of his marriage.

Anne Bosworth Focke left her position in Rhode Island and moved to Cleveland.
Her daughter reported in 1978: “After their marriage, Mother did not teach again,
but worked with Father, grading papers, being a good faculty wife, & having three
children, of whom I am the oldest.” The children were: Helen Metcalf, born June
10, 1902; Theodore Brown, born September 16, 1904; and Alfred Bosworth, born
September 30, 1906.

On May 15 1907, Anne Bosworth Focke died at age thirty-eight of pneumonia,
when her children were not quite ﬁve, three, and one. She was buried in Massillon,
Ohio, her husband’s birthplace. In 1910 her mother and aunt were both living in
the Focke household in Cleveland.

Theodore M. Focke became Kerr professor of mathematics and head of the de-
partment at Case School of Applied Science in 1908 and then served as dean of the
faculty from 1918 until his retirement in 1944, when he was awarded an honorary
doctorate by that institution. He died on March 1, 1949. After earning a BA in
chemistry and an MA in geology from Western Reserve University, Helen Focke
remained there and received a BS in library science; she spent most of her career
on the faculty of the School of Library Science of Case Western Reserve. She died in
October 1997. Theodore Brown Focke received a DSc from the University of Nancy
in France and, after serving as an engineer and then as an executive for various
companies, was the president and director of a tire sales company in Johnstown,
Pennsylvania. Alfred Bosworth Focke received a PhD in physics from the Califor-
nia Institute of Technology and ended his career as professor and chairman of the
physics department of Harvey Mudd College. Theodore Brown Focke and Alfred
Bosworth Focke died within three days of each other in June 1986.
