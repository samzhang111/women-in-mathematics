BERNSTEIN, Dorothy L. April 11, 1914–February 5, 1988.
University of Wisconsin (BA 1934, MA 1934), Brown University (PhD 1939).

Dorothy Lewis Bernstein was born in Chicago, Illinois, the eldest of four surviving
daughters and one son of Tillie (Loyev, later Lewis) (1887–1969) and Jacob Louis
Bernstein (1880–1956). Both parents were born in Russia and immigrated early in
the century. Her father came to New York in 1902 and her mother to Milwaukee in
1907, at which time her mother’s family assumed the name Lewis. Her parents were
married in Milwaukee in 1912 and were naturalized in 1915. The ﬁrst three children,
Dorothy, Naomi (1915–1996), and Myrtle (1917–1992), were born in Chicago where
her father had started a dairy business in 1911. In 1918 the family moved to a
farm in Jackson, Wisconsin, about thirty miles northwest of Milwaukee. The next
two children, Elinor (1919–1920) and Clarice (b. 1922), were born in Jackson. In
1924 the family moved again, this time to Milwaukee where, in 1925, her father
started another dairy, and where their last child, Sheldon, was born in 1927. All
of the surviving children earned advanced degrees, Myrtle (LeBow) an MD and all
the others PhD’s: Sheldon in 1952 (University of Wisconsin, biochemistry), Naomi
(Golan) in 1969 (University of Chicago, social work), and Clarice (Yaﬀa Draznin) in
1985 (University of Southern California, history). In 1972 Yaﬀa Draznin published
It Began with Zade Usher: The History and Record of the Families Bernstein–
Loyev/Lewis–Mazur , for which Dorothy Bernstein wrote the foreword.

Bernstein attended public primary and secondary schools in Milwaukee and grad-
uated from high school as valedictorian in 1930 at age sixteen. She then entered
the University of Wisconsin, where she majored in mathematics. By October 1932,
when she was just over eighteen, the department voted that she be permitted to
follow a program of advanced independent study. During the next two years she
worked with Mark H. Ingraham, Rudolf Langer, and Theodore Bennett and received
her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in 1934 on the basis of a single examination and
a thesis on ﬁnding the complex roots of polynomials by an extension of Newton’s
method. Her last year as an undergraduate she was a University scholar. She was
ﬁrst in a class of two thousand, and her bachelor’s degree was awarded summa cum
laude. After receiving her degrees, she remained at Wisconsin as a University fellow
for the year 1934–35, doing further graduate work and teaching.

Bernstein continued her graduate studies at Brown University, where for two
years, 1935–37, she held a scholarship and taught at Pembroke College, Brown’s
coordinate women’s college. She completed her dissertation on the Laplace double
integral and received her PhD from Brown in 1939. She was also an instructor at
Mount Holyoke College from 1937 to 1940.

Bernstein reported a Milwaukee, Wisconsin, mailing address for the September
1940 AMS membership list. In 1941 she returned to the University of Wiscon-
sin for a year as an instructor. In June 1942 she became a research associate to
the statistician Jerzy Neyman working on theoretical problems in probability at
the Statistical Laboratory of the University of California, Berkeley, where she also
taught a graduate course in probability theory in the mathematics department. In
her 1978 contribution to an AWM panel, published in 1979, she notes that she left
after only eight months because “Neyman and I did not see eye-to-eye on what was
the mathematical justiﬁcation of a statistical procedure” (p. 10). Erich L. Lehmann,
a graduate student at Berkeley at the time, later quoted Neyman as saying that

“Dorothy Bernstein . . . has just come to me and said she doesn’t like the kind of
stuﬀ that we do because it’s not really nice mathematics. She wants to leave” (De-
Groot 1986, 244). Bernstein was unemployed for several months, but in fall 1943 she
moved to the University of Rochester as an instructor. In 1946 she was promoted
to assistant professor, in 1951 to associate professor, and in 1957 to professor. She
spent three years as acting chairman of the department. She also directed three
PhD dissertations, including that of her later collaborator and close friend, Geral-
dine Coon, in 1950. Her other two doctoral students were John M. Perry, 1960, and
David M. Burton, 1961.

While at Rochester she was asked by C. B. Tompkins, who was working at
Engineering Research Associates on a contract from the Oﬃce of Naval Research,
to undertake a study of the current state of knowledge of existence theorems in
partial diﬀerential equations. As she explained in her 1978 AWM talk, “some of the
proofs could be used as basis for the computational solutions of non-linear problems
that were just being tackled by high-speed digital computers.” Her 1950 book with
Princeton University Press was the result of this undertaking. She spent the year
1950–51 as a member of the Institute for Advanced Study and the year 1957–58
as a visiting professor at the Institute for Numerical Analysis of the University of
California, Los Angeles. During the 1950s she wrote more than ﬁfty reviews for
Mathematical Reviews.

In 1959 Bernstein went to Goucher College as professor and remained there
until she retired in 1979 as professor emeritus. She was chairman of the department
from 1960 until 1970 and director of the computer center from 1962 until 1967.
She spent the year 1966–67 as visiting professor of applied mathematics at Brown.
She returned to Brown in the fall of 1973 and spent the spring of 1974 at the
University of Tennessee. While at Goucher, Bernstein became very active in the
uses of the computer in education and in the spring of 1971 was part of a group
that founded the Maryland Association for the Educational Uses of Computers.
She was instrumental in obtaining funds for computers at Goucher and helped run
an NSF summer institute in computer-based mathematics for high school teachers.
At her retirement Goucher presented her with an award for distinguished service
to the college. In 1981 Towson State University awarded her an honorary Doctor
of Humane Letters (LHD). She was a fellow of the AAAS.

In 1985 Bernstein received a Certiﬁcate for Meritorious Service from the Mary-
land-District of Columbia-Virginia Section of the MAA, having served the section
as governor 1965–68 and the national MAA in many capacities. She served on
and chaired various committees and was a member of the editorial board of the
Two-Year College Mathematics Journal. At the national level she was ﬁrst vice
president 1972–73 and president 1978–80, the ﬁrst woman in this role in the MAA’s
history. From the early 1970s through the early 1980s Bernstein was often an invited
speaker at sectional meetings of the MAA. In addition to her work with the MAA,
she served on advisory panels of other national associations and for the National
Science Foundation.

At the time of her retirement from Goucher College in 1979, a pair of articles ap-
peared in the Goucher Quarterly, “Bernstein on Coon” and “Coon on Bernstein.”
Geraldine Coon, Bernstein’s 1950 doctoral student, came to Goucher in 1964 and
retired the same year as Bernstein. After giving a detailed description of Bernstein’s
mathematical activities and work at Goucher, Coon added that in addition to her

duties as president of the MAA, “whenever possible, she indulges in her favorite
hobbies of gardening, canning, and freezing. She intends to maintain the famous
Bernstein Box at the Preakness, where annually the laws of probability and statis-
tics fall into complete disarray” (17). Coon remained at Goucher an additional year
before she returned to her home on the Pawcatuck River in Connecticut. Bernstein
and Coon shared the home until Bernstein’s death.

For several years after her retirement Dorothy L. Bernstein maintained an aﬃlia-
tion with Brown University, which was about forty-ﬁve miles from her Connecticut
home. She died at the Rhode Island Hospital in Providence in February 1988 at
the age of seventy-three. She was survived by her three sisters, Dr. Naomi Golan
and Dr. Myrtle LeBow, both of Israel, and Dr. Yaﬀa Draznin of Los Angeles; and
by her brother, Dr. Sheldon Bernstein of Milwaukee. She was buried in Milwaukee.
