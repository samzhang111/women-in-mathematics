MORENUS, Eugenie M. February 21, 1881–October 15, 1966.
Vassar College (BA 1904, MA 1905), Columbia University (PhD 1922).

Eugenie Maria Morenus was born in Cleveland, New York, the ﬁrst of two chil-
dren of Maria Euphemia (Van Blarcorn) (1855–1924) and Eugene Morenus (1854–
1929), both natives of New York. In the 1900 census her father was described as
manager of a glass works in Cleveland, New York, and later as a manufacturer of
thermometers. Her brother, Jeremiah B. (1884–1969), was also born in New York
State.

In 1900, when she was nineteen, Morenus was a boarder in East Washington,
Pennsylvania, while attending school. After receiving her bachelor’s degree from
Vassar College in 1904, she remained there on a Coykendall scholarship for the year
1904–05, wrote a thesis in algebraic geometry, and received a master’s degree in
1905. From January 1906 until June 1907 Morenus was a teacher of mathematics
and Latin at Watertown (New York) High School. She was a substitute in mathe-
matics at Vassar 1907–08 and was a teacher of mathematics at Poughkeepsie High
School 1908–09.

In 1909, at the age of twenty-eight, Morenus began her long association with
Sweet Briar College, about a dozen miles from Lynchburg, Virginia. This college
for women had just begun to oﬀer instruction at the postsecondary level three years
before she arrived. She was instructor in mathematics and Latin 1909–16, associate
professor of mathematics 1916–18, and then professor of mathematics. She was on
leave 1918–19 and returned as head of the department, a position in which she
continued until her retirement in 1946. Among those hired by Sweet Briar while
Morenus was head of the department were Helen Calkins 1927–28, who was acting
head while Morenus was on leave; Julia Wells Bower 1927–30; Ethel Moody 1930–
33; and Nancy Cole 1933–43, who served as acting head 1934–35 and 1941–42.

After Morenus went to Sweet Briar she continued her studies at the University
of Chicago in the summer of 1912 and at G¨ottingen in the summer of 1913. She
studied at Columbia University in the summers of 1915 and 1916 and held an
alumnae fellowship from Vassar for study at Columbia 1918–19. She studied at
Columbia again during the summers of 1920 and 1921 and received her PhD from
Columbia in 1922. Although she wanted to ﬁnd a position at an institution that
supported research, Morenus returned to Sweet Briar and attempted to continue
her work in diﬀerential geometry. In May 1923 she passed, cum laude, the ﬁrst part
of the associate examination of the American Society of Actuaries.

Morenus often attended meetings of the AMS, and she attended the International
Mathematical Congress in Toronto in 1924 and in Oslo in 1936. She spent the year
1927–28 as an AAUW Anna C. Brackett memorial fellow in Cambridge, England. In
the summer of 1930 she did additional work at the University of Chicago. Morenus
had leaves in 1934–35, when she took an extensive trip that included India, and in
1941–42, when she spent part of the year in Berkeley, California. She later reported
having studied at the University of California.

At Sweet Briar she was known for the excellence of her scholarship and her
high standards. She was active within the college, where for many years she was
secretary of the faculty and was chairman of the committee on instruction. The
Sweet Briar memorial tribute by two colleagues, Gladys Boone and Bertha Wailes,
at the college also conveys a sense of her non-scholarly interests.

One of her earliest outside activities at Sweet Briar was to enroll in
a cookery class oﬀered in the domestic science department which
then existed. She sang in the choir, was considered an excellent pho-
tographer and furnished numerous pictures for the early yearbooks.
She was also interested in athletics, and at times is said to have
helped President Benedict keep an eye on swimmers in the lake.
However, riding was her chief joy, and she and her horse, October,
aﬀectionately known as Toby, were familiar sights in the country-
side as well as on college campus. She rode almost daily, and on
occasion took students on overnight horseback trips to Peaks of
Otter, Natural Bridge, into the mountains to Hog Camp, and to
other distant places otherwise out-of-bounds to student riders.

Dramatics was another of Gene’s loves. She planned and di-
rected faculty plays which were an annual event in those days,
starring in a number of them herself, . . . . During her sojourn in
Lynchburg its Little Theatre also beneﬁted from her talents. (Sweet
Briar College Archives)

Morenus engaged in a number of professional activities. She was a charter mem-
ber of the MAA, was a member of the Virginia Academy of Science, and was active
in the AAUW. For the latter she served as president of the Sweet Briar branch and
as chairman of the education committee of the Virginia division at various times.
During World War I, in response to calls for volunteers to help staﬀ factories, she
worked for six weeks one summer at an overall factory in Lynchburg. Her family
owned a candle factory in her hometown, which required some attention on her
part. It was later sold, and Morenus made bequests to Vassar and to Sweet Briar.
In about 1940 Morenus described herself as an Episcopalian and a Republican. She
was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. She made other trips
abroad in addition to her trips to study in G¨ottingen and Cambridge and her trip
during her leave of 1934–35. These included a trip to Europe in summer 1936, a
cruise in February 1950, and a European trip in 1955.

After her retirement from Sweet Briar in 1946, Morenus changed her address in
AMS membership lists from Sweet Briar to her family home in Cleveland, New York,
northeast of Syracuse. She taught at Connecticut College in 1947, and for some
time after that she spent her summers in Cleveland and her winters in Lynchburg.
Sometime later she moved to Babson Park, Florida. She was in a hospital in Lake
Wales, Florida, most of the last three years of her life.

Eugenie Morenus died in 1966 in Lake Wales at age eighty-ﬁve. She was cremated,
and her ashes were sent back to her home town of Cleveland, New York, where her
brother was living. In 1960 the Eugenie M. Morenus Scholarship endowment was
established by one of the ﬁrst ﬁve graduates of Sweet Briar in the class of 1910.
Proceeds are to beneﬁt a student majoring in mathematics or one of the sciences.
Six months before her death, the Southeastern Section of the MAA recognized her
as one its remaining eight charter members.
Organizational aﬃliations: AMS, MAA (charter member), AAAS (fellow), AAUW,
AAUP.
