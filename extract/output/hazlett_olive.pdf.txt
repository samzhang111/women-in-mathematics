HAZLETT, Olive C. October 27, 1890–March 8, 1974.
Radcliffe College (BA 1912), University of Chicago (MS 1913, PhD 1915).

Olive Clio Hazlett was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the only child of Olive Leonora
(Binkley) (1866–1954) and Robert Hazlett (b. 1862), both natives of Ohio. Her
parents married in November 1888. Around the time of Olive C. Hazlett’s birth
in 1890, her father was a postal clerk for the Railway Mail Service in Cincinnati.
In 1898 her mother graduated from the Laura Memorial Woman’s Medical College
in Cincinnati (after several mergers, now the University of Cincinnati College of
Medicine) and was licensed to practice in Ohio and in Massachusetts. The follow-
ing year, Olive Clio Hazlett moved with her mother to the Boston area. In 1900
her mother was a physician at the Reformatory Prison for Women in Sherborn,
Massachusetts, while her father, a postal clerk, was enumerated with his family in
Zanesville, Ohio. Robert Hazlett was deceased by March 1905.

Olive C. Hazlett attended public schools in Massachusetts, including Maldin High
School 1904–05. She and her mother spent September 1905 through August 1906
traveling in France and England, and then she attended Dorchester High School
in Boston 1906–09. After graduating in 1909, she entered Radcliﬀe College. At
Radcliﬀe, she specialized in mathematics and had advanced courses with Harvard
professors W. E. Byerly, B. O. Peirce, and W. F. Osgood. She was elected to Phi
Beta Kappa and graduated magna cum laude in 1912. A letter written January
18, 1916, indicates that Hazlett spoke of herself as having “done mathematics ever
since she was a child” (M. Carey Thomas to Charlotte A. Scott, Thomas Papers,
Microﬁlm Edition, Reel 134).

During 1912–15 Hazlett did graduate work in mathematics and mathematical as-
tronomy at the University of Chicago. She held a graduate scholarship from Chicago
the ﬁrst year and received her master’s degree in 1913. The next two years she held
a graduate fellowship from Chicago, and during her ﬁnal year she also held a Boston
alumnae fellowship awarded by the Boston branch of the Association of Collegiate
Alumnae (later the American Association of University Women). She received her
PhD magna cum laude in 1915. The majority of her courses were with E. H. Moore
and L. E. Dickson in mathematics and with F. R. Moulton in astronomy. Both her
master’s thesis and her doctoral dissertation concerned the characterization of cer-
tain types of algebras and were directed by Dickson. Hazlett was Dickson’s second
female doctoral student, following by two years Mildred Leonora Sanderson, who
died in October 1914 after one semester as an instructor at Wisconsin.

In 1915–16, the year after she received her PhD, Hazlett was an Alice Freeman
Palmer memorial fellow of Wellesley College for postdoctoral study at Harvard Uni-
versity. By 1916 she had published three papers about linear associative algebras
and was later to become the most proliﬁc of the women working in pure mathe-
matics among those who earned PhD’s in mathematics before 1940. Her later work
concerned modular invariants and covariants.

In February 1916, Hazlett was oﬀered a two-year appointment as an associate
in mathematics at Bryn Mawr College. Hazlett was not reappointed in 1918, but
was hired by Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts. At the same
time, Anna J. Pell (Wheeler) moved from Mount Holyoke to Bryn Mawr as as-
sociate professor. At Mount Holyoke, Hazlett was assistant professor 1918–24 and
associate professor 1924–25. During most of her time at Mount Holyoke, Hazlett

and her mother, who was experiencing some health problems, were living in the
nearby town of Holyoke, Massachusetts. In addition to her regular classroom teach-
ing responsibilities at Mount Holyoke, Hazlett directed much of the work of the
mathematics honors students.

Hazlett’s years at Mount Holyoke were to be some of her most productive re-
search years, and her accomplishments were acknowledged by the mathematics
community. In 1920 she was awarded $100 by the American Association for the
Advancement of Science “in support of her work in the theory of hypercomplex
numbers and invariants” (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 26:467); she also published half
a dozen major research papers while at Mount Holyoke. Her work in invariants and
modular analysis was recognized by O. D. Kellogg in his 1921 article, “A decade
of American mathematics,” in Science. In addition, her long tenure as cooperating
editor (also called associate editor) of the Transactions of the AMS began with the
January 1923 issue. In short, she was a major ﬁgure in algebra in the United States.
By late winter in 1925 Hazlett was looking for another position. She indicated in
a letter to E. J. Townsend, the department chair at Illinois, on April 10, 1925, that
her only reason for considering leaving Mount Holyoke was so she would have better
research opportunities, namely, a better library and contact with other mathemati-
cians doing research. A letter of March 5, 1925, to Townsend from the American
College Bureau had inquired whether they would consider hiring a woman for the
following year and had noted that Dickson had written that she is “one of the
two most noted women in America in the ﬁeld of Mathematics” (Personnel ﬁle,
University of Illinois Department of Mathematics records).

Hazlett had written to Townsend earlier describing her many academic achieve-
ments. On March 18, 1925, she noted that she had read at least one paper a year
before the AMS since 1915 and attended meetings on the average of twice a year. She
also noted her participation in the 1924 International Congress of Mathematicians
in Toronto, as well as her position on the editorial committee of the Transactions
of the AMS. She mentioned, too, that she was a member of committee G of AAUP,
which she described as concerned with “increasing the intellectual interest and rais-
ing the intellectual standards of the undergraduate” (Personnel ﬁle, University of
Illinois Department of Mathematics records).

L. E. Dickson wrote to Townsend on her behalf on March 30, 1925. Among his
comments are those concerning her mathematics, teaching, and certain aspects of
her character and personal life.

. . . She has shown more independence in research than any of our
Doctors for [the] past ten years – and has published perhaps a
dozen excellent papers in several branches of algebra showing real
originality and the ability to attack successfully quite fundamen-
tal problems. Her tested ability and her continued eagerness for
research make it certain she will have a very successful career in
research. . . .

Miss H. has been a bit unhappy at times, partly on acct of very
poor math library at her school, & partly because her taking care
of her mother has made it hard for her to make ends meet on a
modest salary. . . .

During the 2 years or more that Miss H. was here, I always
found her to be quite a normal person, easy to get on with. . . . The

Book Web Page

drawback that she has been at times a bit unhappy (for reasons
cited) would I am sure be completely remedied by her transfer to
a place like U. Ill., since she is so eager to get to a live place with
a real library. . . .

I am sure she would have the greatest respect & consideration
for her colleagues in your dept. Also that she would be most con-
scientious in her teaching & in carrying out the wishes of the head
of her dept.

I think it certain you couldn’t ﬁnd so competent a research per-
son as she without calling a full professor (& not many of latter are
her equal.) Her circumstances require a salary of at least $3000 –
& she is worth much more. . . .

A person of such high math. ability deserves a post in a lead-
ing math. dept. Since she is most kind hearted & considerate, I
would fear no diﬃculty in her relations to colleagues & students.
(Personnel ﬁle, University of Illinois Department of Mathematics
records)

In 1925 Hazlett took a demotion in rank to join the faculty at the University of
Illinois, and on January 1, 1926, she was elected to a three-year term as a member
of the council of the AMS. She was promoted to associate professor in 1929 and
was associate professor emeritus after her formal retirement from Illinois in 1959.
In 1927 she was “starred” for mathematics in American Men of Science, one of only
two women “starred” in that ﬁeld before 1940 (Charlotte Scott had been “starred”
for mathematics in 1903 and Christine Ladd-Franklin for psychology in 1906).

In addition to her other teaching, Hazlett taught a graduate course in the theory
of numbers during the academic year 1927–28. In January 1928 she requested a
leave from the University of Illinois for study in Europe and received a Guggenheim
fellowship for 1928–29 “for the study of the arithmetics of linear associative algebras
together with their application and interpretation in other lines of mathematics,
especially the theory of numbers” (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 34:388). She sailed from
New York to Genoa in June 1928 and spent the summer in the Italian Alps with her
mother. On September 1, 1928, Hazlett arrived in Bologna where she presented a
paper at the International Congress of Mathematicians. Following a tour of Florence
and other Italian towns, she arrived in Rome on September 22 and remained there
for most of the year except for a few weeks in Zurich. She had hoped to meet with
Emmy Noether in G¨ottingen to discuss their work, but learned that Noether was in
Moscow in the winter of 1928–29. Realizing that she would not be able to accomplish
everything she wanted by September 1929, Hazlett applied for and received a one
year renewal of her Guggenheim “for continuation of studies of the arithmetics of
linear associative algebras” (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 35:743). She also received a
second leave of absence from Illinois under the condition that she promise to return
to the University and with a commitment for a promotion to associate professor
with an increase in salary. During her second year in Europe she also studied in
G¨ottingen.

When Hazlett resumed her work at Illinois, she received the promised promotion
and raise, but her teaching was less satisfying, since she wanted more work with
advanced students and less with elementary students. At this time her research
productivity diminished.

Hazlett’s mother had broken her leg during the summer and remained in Rome
after Hazlett returned to Illinois. R. D. Carmichael, the department head at this
time, wrote to Olive B. Hazlett in early January 1931 informing her that her daugh-
ter had not been very well since her return to Illinois in September and that she
had not had energy for her research, but that she seemed to be improving. During
the following few years Hazlett remained in her position at Illinois. However, in a
letter on December 11, 1936, Arthur B. Coble, the head of the mathematics de-
partment, wrote to A. C. Willard, the university president that he was “very sorry
to report that Professor Olive C. Hazlett has suﬀered a nervous breakdown and
that her physician . . . says that in all likelihood she will not be able to resume her
duties before June” (Personnel ﬁle, University of Illinois Department of Mathemat-
ics records). Hazlett was granted a leave of absence for illness December 1, 1936,
through August 1937; the leave was with pay, but her salary was reduced to cover
expenses for her replacements. After about a week in the university hospital, she
was taken to Rogers Memorial Sanitarium in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, where she
remained for several months before spending some time in Chicago. In spring 1937
she asked to extend the leave of absence until September 1938, and the leave was
granted. In May 1937 a blow to Hazlett was the death of Herbert Slaught, the Uni-
versity of Chicago mathematics professor in whose home Hazlett had lived her last
two years at Chicago. Although Hazlett had asked for and received a leave without
pay, she found herself with ﬁnancial troubles in autumn 1937, largely because she
needed to contribute to the support of her mother.

Hazlett spent most of the year 1937–38 in Colorado, ﬁrst in Denver and then in
Estes Park. Although Hazlett had no oﬃcial doctoral students, during the period
that she was on leave Donald Meeker Brown ﬁnished his dissertation, Arithmetics of
Rational Generalized Quaternion Division Algebras, under the direction of Henry R.
Brahana but wrote in the “Acknowledgments” of his “appreciation of the guidance
furnished by Professor Olive C. Hazlett in preparing [him] for the solution of the
problem considered in this dissertation.”

Hazlett returned to work at Illinois in September 1938. After a few years, how-
ever, she was committed by court order on November 20, 1944, to the Neuropsy-
chiatric Institute of the University of Illinois in Chicago. At some point she was
given a conditional parole but was committed by the Champaign County Court
on March 13, 1945, to the Kankakee State Hospital in Kankakee, Illinois. She was
on a temporary disability leave with pay until May 1945, after which she was on
permanent disability leave until her retirement in the late 1950s.

In 1953, with the help of a Kankakee physician and attorney, Hazlett petitioned
for her own release from the state hospital. A petition for a writ of habeas corpus
was ﬁled on September 23, 1953, and after a hearing and evidence, the court found
the “petitioner not mentally ill and therefore illegally restrained of her liberties”
(Record 55, p. 344, ﬁled October 2, 1953, Clerk of the Circuit Court, Kankakee
County). She was discharged from custody after which she moved to her cabin,
Timeless Lodge, in Peterborough, New Hampshire. Her mother died in Boston less
than a year later.

Olive C. Hazlett was described by Lucretia Levy, a former colleague and oﬃce
mate for a year, as a kind and gentle lady and a pleasant oﬃce mate who seemed
very much alone. Hazlett’s interests were varied. In 1937 she described them as “rock
climbing especially above timberline and when the technique is pressure climbing;

landscape photography, especially working across the light or into the light; Oriental
rugs and other” (Owens questionnaire). In about 1940 Hazlett described herself as a
Socialist and as an Anglo-Catholic. After Hazlett moved to New Hampshire, she was
befriended by several local Discalced Carmelite brothers and was deeply involved
as a lay woman in the order. At the time of her death she was a member of the
Carmelite Third Order, an organization of lay people known as Tertiaries.

After living in Peterborough for nearly two decades, Hazlett spent some months
in a Keene, New Hampshire, nursing home before her death there at eighty-three
in 1974. She was buried in Peterborough. In 1984 Olive C. Hazlett was one of three
mathematicians whose lives were celebrated in Case-of-the-Month, “Commemorat-
ing American Mathematics,” exhibited in the Smithsonian Institution’s National
Museum of American History.
