CRATHORNE, Charlotte Elvira (Pengra). May 30, 1875–February 9, 1916.
University of Wisconsin (BA 1897, PhD 1901).

Charlotte Elvira Pengra was born in Juda, Wisconsin, the eldest of ﬁve children
of Mary Ellen (Preston) (b. 1853) and Winﬁeld Sherman Pengra (b. 1847), both
natives of Wisconsin. In 1880 the family was living in Jeﬀerson, Wisconsin, near
Madison, and her father was a farmer; in 1900 they lived in Madison and he was a
landlord. All of the ﬁve Pengra children received bachelor’s degrees from the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin; in addition to Charlotte, they were Mabel (b. 1877), Preston
(b. 1880), Delia (b. 1882), and Marshall (b. 1885), and they earned their degrees in
1899, 1902, 1904, and 1905, respectively.

Charlotte Pengra graduated from the Madison, Wisconsin, high school before
attending the University of Wisconsin, from which she received her BA in 1897, the
same year that Wisconsin awarded its ﬁrst PhD in mathematics. She then taught
in high schools in Fox Lake and Sparta, both in Wisconsin. In a letter to Charles S.
Slichter, inquiring about a possible fellowship for graduate study at the University
of Wisconsin, written May 12, 1899, from Sparta, Pengra indicated that she wanted
a more complete college education for its own sake and because she would like to
teach mathematics to students more advanced than in the high school. She indicated
that she wanted to take a PhD, probably from Wisconsin, and that if she had the
fellowship she would not teach again until she received the degree. Whereas the
ﬁnancial question was “not very pressing,” she wrote that if she did not get the
fellowship she would stay in Sparta (Biographical Files, Charles S. Slichter, Box
35, Miscellaneous University Correspondence 1886–1946, University of Wisconsin-
Madison Archives). She did receive it and completed her work for the PhD with
L. W. Dowling two years later, as the third Wisconsin PhD in mathematics. After
receiving her doctorate, Pengra was in charge of the mathematics department of a
high school in Elgin, Illinois, for three years.

On June 21, 1904, in Madison, Charlotte Pengra married the English-born
Arthur Robert Crathorne (1873–1946), who had been a graduate student and in-
structor in mathematics at Wisconsin. He had come to the United States with his
family as a young boy, grew up in Illinois, received a bachelor’s degree from the
University of Illinois in 1898, was a tutor in mathematics and astronomy at the
University of Maine, and had been at Wisconsin since 1900. Shortly after the wed-
ding they sailed from Montreal to Liverpool to spend some time in England before
continuing to Germany.

The Crathornes spent the years 1904 through 1907 studying mathematics at
G¨ottingen, where A. R. Crathorne received his PhD in 1907. Their daughter Mary
Preston was born on November 28, 1906. On their return from G¨ottingen, A. R.
Crathorne took a position at the University of Illinois. The Crathornes had two
more children: Anne Harrison, born July 31, 1909, and Arthur Robert Jr., born
June 5, 1911.

Charlotte Crathorne’s daughters report that she was a collaborator in the prepa-
ration of College Algebra by H. L. Rietz and A. R. Crathorne in 1909, although she
is not mentioned in the extensive acknowledgements in the preface to the book.

After an illness of about three years, Charlotte Crathorne died of breast cancer
at her parents’ home in Brodhead, Wisconsin, in 1916 at age forty. She was buried

of his career at Illinois.
