NEWTON, Abba V. February 19, 1908–May 5, 1996.
Mount Holyoke College (BA 1929), University of Chicago (MA 1931, PhD
1933).

Abba Verbeck Newton was the younger of two daughters of Sarah C. (Verbeck)
(1880–1962) and Samuel Smith Newton (1875–1964). Her father, born in Albany,
New York, and her mother, born in Ballston Spa, New York, married in 1905. Abba
Newton and her older sister, Katharine Marguerite (1906–1994), were both born
in Ballston Spa, where their father worked in the oﬃce of the American Hide and
Leather Company. Katharine Newton became an elementary school music teacher.
Abba Newton attended Ballston Spa High School 1920–24 and St. Margaret’s
School in Waterbury, Connecticut, 1924–25 before entering Mount Holyoke College.
While there she was in the class choir and was a Sarah Willison scholar before
graduating magna cum laude with major subjects mathematics and chemistry in
1929. She taught mathematics at Science Hill School, a girls’ preparatory school
in Shelbyville, Kentucky, the following year and studied mathematics education at
Teachers College, Columbia, in the summer of 1930.

Newton attended the University of Chicago from the fall of 1930 through the
summer of 1933, taking oﬀ only one quarter, summer 1932, during that time. She
held a scholarship during 1932–33. She received her master’s degree in 1931, with a
thesis directed by Mayme Logsdon, and her doctorate in 1933, with a dissertation
directed by E. P. Lane.

Having received her PhD in the midst of the Great Depression, Newton was
unemployed until April of 1934 when she began teaching in an instructor’s absence
at American International College in Springﬁeld, Massachusetts. She remained there
as instructor of mathematics and chemistry until 1938. Newton then joined the
faculty at Hartwick College in Oneonta, New York, replacing Hazel Schoonmaker
(Wilson) as the professor of mathematics after Schoonmaker left to marry in the
summer of 1938. Newton remained at Hartwick until 1943, after which she taught
two classes in the summer of 1943 at the University of Chicago and held a one-year
appointment as assistant professor at Smith College 1943–44 as a substitute for a
member of the faculty on leave for war work.

In 1944 Newton accepted an assistant professorship at Vassar College, where
she was to remain for the next twenty-nine years. She was promoted to associate
professor in 1950 and to professor in 1957. She chaired the department at Vassar
1950–51, 1953–58, and 1966–67, and retired as professor emeritus in 1973. While at
Vassar she was a faculty fellow at the Institute Henri Poincar´e at the Sorbonne in
1951 and at Duke University in 1966. She was an NSF science faculty fellow at the
University of Michigan 1958–59 and a visiting research fellow at Princeton in 1971.
After her retirement, Abba Verbeck continued to live in Poughkeepsie, New York.
When she was younger, she had indicated an interest in tennis, rowing, and hik-
ing. Newton was a member of the Adirondack Mountain Club from about 1946 at
least through the early 1980s. She served as an alumnae trustee of St. Margaret’s
School 1965–70 and was a member of the Dutchess County Council on World Af-
fairs. She was an Episcopalian and sang in the choir at Christ Episcopal Church
in Poughkeepsie. Newton died at age eighty-eight at Eden Park Nursing Home in
Poughkeepsie. She was survived by cousins and was buried in the family plot in the
Ballston Spa Cemetery.
