BALLARD, Ruth (Mason). April 24, 1906–June 7, 1980.
Wellesley College (BA 1926), University of Chicago (MS 1928, PhD 1932).

Ruth Glidden Mason was born in Chicago, Illinois, the younger of two children of
Bertha Hall (Sickles) (1866–1937) and Fred Bonfoy Mason (1870–1932). Her mother
was in one of the earliest classes, possibly the ﬁrst, at Michael Reese Hospital
School of Nursing in Chicago. Her father was an 1890 graduate of Oberlin College
and became an insurance agent in Chicago. They married in 1902, and their son,
Ira Jenckes, was born in 1904. He attended Yale University and the University of
Michigan and died in 1992.

Ruth Mason attended the Knickerbocker grammar school and Robert Waller
High School, both public schools in Chicago. After her high school graduation at
age sixteen, she studied one year at the University of Chicago before completing
her undergraduate work in 1926 after three years at Wellesley College.

Mason immediately entered the University of Chicago where, after graduate
study during the academic year 1926–27 and the spring and summer quarters of
1928, she received her master’s degree in 1928. She wrote her thesis under the
direction of Mayme Irwin Logsdon. During 1930–31 she was both a Horton-Hallowell
fellow (from Wellesley) and a graduate fellow at Chicago. She studied one semester
with D. N. Lehmer at the University of California in 1930 before ﬁnishing the work
for her PhD at Chicago in 1932.

When Mason joined the MAA in 1932 she indicated that she was doing private
research in Berkeley. She remained in the area doing some postdoctoral work at the
University of California, Berkeley, in the years 1932–34 and taught at the College
of the Holy Names (now Holy Names University) in Oakland, California, in 1933.
During this period she gave her ﬁrst talks on women in mathematics: in June 1933
to the Junior Mathematics Club at the University of Chicago and in November
1934 to Pi Mu Epsilon at the University of California, Berkeley. In a letter to Helen
Owens of August 11, 1937, Mason wrote that “a few years ago while preparing a
paper on Women in Mathematics, I realized that the really interesting part of their
history is that of the progress of recent decades. Before that time a trained aptitude
in mathematics was enough to make a woman a conspicuous and historical freak.
Now even our maiden aunts merely think that mathematics is a somewhat odd ﬁeld
for a woman to work in” (Owens Papers).

Ruth Mason returned to the East and taught at Wellesley in the spring semester
of 1935. Then she was an instructor at Hood College in Frederick, Maryland, 1935–
36 before moving back to Illinois where, except for travel, she remained. She taught
at the University of Illinois in Urbana 1936–38, as assistant the ﬁrst year and
instructor the second. She made a trip to Europe in summer 1938 and joined the
faculty at Wright Junior College in Chicago that fall; she remained at Wright for
ﬁve years. She was chairman of the mathematics section of the Illinois Association
of Junior Colleges 1939–40. That same year she served as secretary-treasurer of
the Chicago Mathematical Model Club and demonstrated materials for freshman
mathematics that had been made under the auspices of the WPA.

On April 20, 1940, Ruth Mason married Foster K. Ballard (1899–1978), a grad-
uate of the University of Chicago, chemist for the US Customs Service, and a long-
time friend of her brother. At about this time Ruth Mason Ballard was appointed
to the newly formed MAA Committee on Section Meetings; she remained on the

committee until 1947. She remained at Wright only until 1943, when circumstances
required a change. Her holiday letter of 1943 describes the situation.

Until last June there were no radical changes in our way of life. . . .
Enrollment was falling oﬀ at Wright – Boys were leaving for the
armed forces, and girls for jobs. There had once been seven faculty
members in our department; by last June there were ﬁve. Then
on the morning of the ﬁrst day of ﬁnal examinations came the
order that because the Navy was taking over the building, the
Wright Junior College faculty were to be out by ﬁve-thirty that
evening. . . . The students took ﬁnal examinations while the rooms
were being dismantled around their heads. We ﬁnished the semester
at Herzl, . . . a Junior College on the west side of Chicago. (letter
provided to author by Fred E. Ballard)

Wright College was saved, although the enrollment dropped from about three
thousand a few years earlier to about six hundred. Ballard was on leave of absence,
but was teaching again in July 1943, this time in a Navy V-12 program for sailors,
housed at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. She continued teaching
in this program until 1945.

The Ballards’ son, Fred Everett, was born on May 26, 1946. For the next few
years Ruth Ballard’s activities focused on playground groups, Cub Scouts, and
PTA, while she continued to teach Sunday school in the Episcopal church and
serve as a choir mother and member of the vestry. Throughout her life she enjoyed
travel in the United States and cultural activities in Chicago: theater, museums,
and opera. She was interested in mathematical puzzles and had some original ones
published. She also maintained her involvement with the Women’s Mathematics
Club of Chicago and Vicinity.

From 1955 until her retirement in 1972, Ballard taught full time as assistant
professor and then associate professor at the University of Illinois at Navy Pier
(moved and renamed the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle in 1965, now the
University of Illinois at Chicago). During this period she was program director in
1962–63 and president in 1963–64 of the Women’s Mathematics Club. She also
produced notes for an elementary college geometry course that were copyrighted in
1971.

Ruth Ballard died at seventy-four in 1980 at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke’s Hos-
pital in Chicago. The funeral was held in St. Augustine’s Episcopal Church in
Wilmette. She was survived by her son, two grandchildren, and her brother.
