COLPITTS, Julia T. February 22, 1875–August 8, 1936.
University of Mount Allison College (BA 1899), Cornell University (MA
1900, PhD 1924).

Julia Trueman Colpitts was born in Pointe de Bute, New Brunswick, Canada,
the third of eight children of Celia Eliza (Trueman) (1848–1930) and James Wal-
lace Colpitts (ca. 1844–1919), who married in 1871. The family was from a long
line of farm families in New Brunswick. The children were Edwin Henry (1872–
1949), Andrew Weldon (1874–1901), Julia, Albert James (1876–1950), Elmer Clif-
ford (1879–1963), Laura Jane (1882–1948), Walter Howard (1886–1972), and Mary
Alice (1892–1920).

Several of the children went into teaching or scientiﬁc careers. Edwin, the el-
dest, ﬁrst attended normal school in New Brunswick before earning a bachelor’s
degree at Mount Allison and an additional BA and an MS at Harvard. He was a
distinguished communications engineer whose career was with the American Bell
Telephone Company. Elmer C. Colpitts earned a PhD in mathematics from Cornell
University in 1906 as a student of Virgil Snyder. His retirement from the State Col-
lege of Washington (now Washington State University) was reported in 1950. Mary
Colpitts, who also studied at Mount Allison, was an instructor of mathematics at
the University of Wisconsin when she died of tuberculosis at age twenty-eight.

Julia Colpitts attended the public high school at Pointe de Bute and the normal
School at Fredericton, New Brunswick, from which she graduated. She graduated
from the University of Mount Allison College in 1899 with honors in mathematics.
The next year she studied at Cornell University where she earned her master’s
degree in 1900.

After receiving her master’s degree, Colpitts joined the faculty at Iowa State
College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (now Iowa State University of Science
and Technology) as an instructor. She was promoted to assistant professor in 1906
and to associate professor in 1913. Colpitts studied at the University of Chicago
during the summer of 1912, at Columbia University during the summer of 1915, and
again at Chicago during the summer of 1919. In addition, she took many graduate
courses at Iowa State for which she received no credit since she was a member of
the faculty. She coauthored an analytic geometry textbook with Maria Roberts, her
mathematics department colleague and with whose family she was boarding at the
time of the 1910 census. The book ﬁrst appeared in 1918, with a second edition in
1926.

In addition to taking graduate courses at Iowa State, Colpitts had also taught
graduate courses by the time she applied to Cornell in February 1922. Included
among her letters of recommendation was one of March 15, 1922, from a former
student who had done graduate work at Wisconsin, Yale, and Columbia. This stu-
dent felt that Colpitts was surpassed by no other teacher of mathematics “with the
single exception of Professor Pierpont of Yale” (Mary G. Miller to J. H. Tanner,
Graduate School Records, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell
University Library).

In 1922–23 Colpitts was granted a leave from Iowa State in order to study at
Cornell. During that year she took a number of courses and worked on a dissertation
with C. F. Craig. She then returned to Iowa State and remained on the faculty
for the rest of her career. In early 1924 Craig went on leave to Europe, and J.

I. Hutchinson replaced him as the chairman of her doctoral committee. Colpitts
received her PhD in 1924 at age forty-nine with her major analysis, ﬁrst minor
geometry, and second minor philosophy. In the summer of 1929 she did further
studies at the University of Chicago.

Colpitts held leadership positions in a number of professional organizations. She
was national secretary in 1926 and national president in 1927 of Sigma Delta Ep-
silon, the graduate women’s scientiﬁc fraternity. She then became active in the Iowa
Section of the MAA and served as vice chairman 1928–29 and 1932–33 and as chair-
man 1935–36. She was a member of the Iowa Academy of Science and was chair of
the mathematics section for the April 1936 meeting of the academy. She attended
the International Congress of Mathematicians in Toronto in 1924, in Bologna in
1928, and in Oslo in 1936.

Julia Colpitts was scheduled to depart for the United States from Hamburg
on August 6, 1936, after the Oslo congress but became ill and died on August 8
in Southampton, England. She was sixty-one at the time of her death. The Julia
Colpitts Memorial Fund was established in her memory by her brother Edwin H.
Colpitts, with the income to be used to purchase books in mathematics for the
Mount Allison library.
