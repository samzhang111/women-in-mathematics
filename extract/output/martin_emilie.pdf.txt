MARTIN, Emilie Norton. December 30, 1869–February 8, 1936.
Bryn Mawr College (BA 1894, PhD 1901).

Emilie Norton Martin was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, the eldest of three
surviving children of Mary Holmes (Ford) (b. 1838) and Robert Wilkie Martin
(b. 1841) of Pennsylvania. Her parents married in 1868, and her siblings were a
sister, Mary Ford (b. 1871), and a brother, Collier Ford (1873–1941). Her father
was a surgeon, and her brother became a physician and professor of medicine in
Philadelphia.

Martin was prepared for college at Mrs. E. L. Head’s School in Germantown,
Philadelphia, and by private study. She entered Bryn Mawr College in 1890 and
remained a student aﬃliated with the college for most of the decade. Her major
areas of study as an undergraduate were Latin and mathematics. Immediately after
she earned her bachelor’s degree in 1894, she began graduate studies there.

Martin was a graduate student in mathematics and physics during the ﬁrst se-
mester 1894–95 and was a teacher of Latin in the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore
during the second semester of that year. She resumed her studies as a fellow in
mathematics 1895–96 and continued as a graduate student 1896–97. The Mathe-
matics Journal Club at Bryn Mawr began in the fall of 1896, and records show
that Martin, who spoke on a topic in group theory, was one of four graduate stu-
dents who gave presentations that year. The other speakers were Charlotte A. Scott
and James Harkness, the Bryn Mawr mathematics faculty members; Frank Morley
and E. W. Brown, mathematics faculty from nearby Haverford College; and Isabel
Maddison, an 1896 Bryn Mawr PhD recipient who was a reader in mathematics.

Charlotte Scott, in a letter of March 19, 1897, to Felix Klein, wrote, “I am expect-
ing to send two of my best students to G¨ottingen next year; to both of them have
been awarded College Fellowships, . . . . One of them you met when you were here
that Sunday afternoon” (Klein Nachlass, XI, Briefe an Klein, Universit¨atsarchiv
G¨ottingen). One was Emilie Martin, as a holder of the Mary E. Garrett European
fellowship; other Bryn Mawr students in G¨ottingen during the year 1897–98 were
Virginia Ragsdale and Fanny Gates. All were in Klein’s course in Mechanik during
the winter semester, and Martin and Ragsdale were in the course in the summer
semester of 1897–98. Ragsdale also studied with David Hilbert at G¨ottingen.

Martin returned to Bryn Mawr as a fellow by courtesy in mathematics for the
year 1898–99. According to the description of her life given in her dissertation,
she studied mathematics with Charlotte Scott and James Harkness, passed her
doctoral examination in the spring of 1899, with a “double minor” in physics, which
she studied under Arthur Stanley Mackenzie. Although her name and dissertation
title appear in the 1899 commencement program and on the 1899 list in Science
of doctorates conferred, her PhD was dated 1901, the year her dissertation was
published. The published version, which bears a slightly diﬀerent title than the title
that appeared in 1899, was mentioned in G. A. Miller’s second and third reports
on progress in ﬁnite group theory published in the Bulletin of the AMS in 1902
and 1907, respectively. Her dissertation was written under the direction of James
Harkness; nonetheless, Harkness does not seem to have been the faculty member
by whom she felt most inﬂuenced. Martin later endowed a mathematical book fund
inspiration given during her study under
at Bryn Mawr “in appreciation of . . .

the guidance of Professor Charlotte Angas Scott” (Bryn Mawr College Library,
Mathematical Book Fund).

Emilie Martin’s ﬁrst position after leaving Bryn Mawr in 1899 was as a teacher
of mathematics in the Misses Kirk’s School, Rosemont, Pennsylvania, during 1899–
1900. She was also a collaborator for the Revue semestrielle des publications math´e-
matiques during the years 1899–1902. Martin did postgraduate work at Bryn Mawr
in 1901–02, when her name again appears on the list of those giving talks in the
journal club. She was also a private tutor of mathematics and Latin 1893–1903.

Martin took a position as instructor at Mount Holyoke College in 1903. She was
an instructor there 1903–04 and ﬁrst semester 1904–05. She had a leave of absence
for the second semester of 1904–05. During this period she compiled the general
index for the years 1891–1904 of the Bulletin of the AMS. Martin returned to Bryn
Mawr for postdoctoral study in 1906–07 and again participated in the journal club.
Her presentations were on methods of representing functions of a complex variable
and on Klein’s new kind of Riemann surface.

In 1907 Martin returned to Mount Holyoke College as instructor. She remained
at that rank until 1911, when she was promoted to associate professor. She was
promoted to professor in 1925 and became professor emeritus after her resignation
in September 1935. She was also department chairman from 1927 through 1935.

Martin described herself as a Presbyterian in 1914 and later was said to have
maintained an interest in religious issues. Also in 1914, she listed herself as a member
of the American Geographical Society and the College Club of Philadelphia. In
addition to her work as a mathematics professor, she was a resident faculty member
of Pearsons Hall, where she lived during the greater part of her career at Mount
Holyoke. She also was secretary of the Mount Holyoke branch of the AAUP. She
traveled in Europe in the summer of 1926. For many years she spent summers with
her sister in Montreat, North Carolina.

In 1934 Emilie Martin was diagnosed with cancer and underwent surgery in June
of that year. She resigned her position in September 1935 and died in February
1936 at age sixty-six in her apartment in Hooker House on the Mount Holyoke
campus. One of Martin’s closest friends, Frances Haynes, assistant librarian at
Mount Holyoke, accompanied her body to Philadelphia, where she was buried.
