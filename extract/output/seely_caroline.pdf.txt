SEELY, Caroline E. August 3, 1887–May 17, 1961.
Barnard College (BA 1911), Columbia University (MA 1912, PhD 1915).

Caroline Eustis Seely was born in Delhi, New York, the daughter of Sarah Au-
gusta (Wheeler), born in 1846 in Delhi, New York, and Henry Bates Seely, born
in 1838 in Seneca Falls, New York. Her parents married in about 1870 and had
four children: Carleton H. (ca. 1872–1885), Annie (b. ca. 1874), Mary (b. 1879),
and Caroline. Her mother was from a Delhi professional family; Caroline’s maternal
grandfather was an attorney in Delhi and in Chicago. Caroline Seely’s father was
a naval oﬃcer who had graduated from the US Naval Academy in 1857. Before her
birth he served on a number of ships, one of which was part of the South Atlantic
blockading squadron early in the Civil War. After 1864 he commanded several ships
and later the Ajax, European, and South Atlantic squadrons. In 1880 Henry Seely,
convalescing from typhoid, was living with his wife and three children at the home
of his mother-in-law in Delphi. From 1884 until 1891 he was captain, and then
commandant, of the League Island Navy Yard in Philadelphia. He commanded a
ship from March 1891 until 1892, after which he was retired. In 1900 the Seely
family was living in Philadelphia. Henry Seely died there in 1901 when Caroline
was thirteen.

In 1910 Caroline Seely and her widowed mother were living in New York City,
where Caroline Seely was attending Barnard College, from which she graduated
with honors in mathematics in 1911. She then did graduate work at Columbia
University and served as an assistant in mathematics to David Eugene Smith at
Teachers College, Columbia, in 1911–13. Seely had taken two courses from Smith as
an undergraduate: theory and practice of teaching mathematics during the summer
of 1910 and history of mathematics in 1910–11. She received her master’s degree in
1912 with a thesis in analysis and continued her graduate work in mathematics at
Columbia. Her doctoral dissertation, directed by Edward Kasner, was completed in
1914, and the degree was awarded by Columbia the following year.

In 1913 Seely began a twenty-two year association with the American Mathe-
matical Society when she became the ﬁrst mathematician to be employed full time
by the society. Her ﬁrst position with the AMS was clerical and editorial assis-
tant. She wrote to David Eugene Smith in the fall of 1913 that she was “enjoying
her new work very much, thanks to [him], but [was] afraid she [would] be rather
homesick for Teachers College . . . ” (Professional Correspondence, David Eugene
Smith Professional Collection, Archival Collections, Rare Book and Manuscript Li-
brary, Columbia University Libraries). Frank Nelson Cole, professor at Columbia
and Barnard and secretary of the AMS since 1895, was editor-in-chief of the Bul-
letin of the AMS from 1899 until his resignation as secretary of the society in 1920.
In addition to Seely’s duties involving work of the society as clerk to Cole, she
was engaged in editorial work for the Bulletin and the Transactions of the AMS.
Seely continued her work with the society when R. G. D. Richardson of Brown re-
placed Cole as secretary in 1920. Seely was oﬃcially associate editor of the Bulletin
1925–34 and was cooperating editor of the Transactions 1924–36.

Seely lived in New York City, where she worked for the AMS and served as
secretary to Cole at Columbia. During World War I, she was associated with F. R.
Moulton and worked with the Army Ordnance Department in Washington, D.C.
She continued her mathematical research in analysis during and after the war. In

1918 she prepared a Union List of Mathematical Periodicals for the Bureau of
Education with David Eugene Smith.

At some point in 1934, Seely submitted her resignation to the AMS. In October
1934, J. R. Kline, an associate secretary of the society, reporting for a committee to
study problems of the New York oﬃce, wrote to the council of the AMS, “The com-
mittee used all eﬀorts within the dignity of the Society to secure the withdrawal of
this resignation, but without success” (T. H. Hildebrandt Papers, Bentley Historical
Library, University of Michigan).

In November 1934, Seely purchased nearly seventeen acres of land in the village
of Willseyville in the town of Candor in Tioga County, New York, with the plan to
retire the following spring. Seely wrote to D. E. Smith in November 1934, “Thanks
very much for your kind letter; it is nice to feel that my ﬁrst boss still remembers
me. Yes, I am leaving the Society’s oﬃce on April 1, to start a chicken farm; my
friends tell me this is a very appropriate day for such a move. But most of them
don’t know New York State as well as you and I do, and don’t realize how beautiful
it is up there” (David Eugene Smith Professional Collection).

A year later she wrote to Smith, “It is lovely up here, and I enjoy being a farmer
very much indeed. But it takes some time and money to get a farm in working
order, and my part time job with the Transactions will run out this spring, with
the completion of the ﬁrst volume for 1936; I should have been glad if it had lasted
a little longer, until my chickens are more steady on their feet. So if you hear of
any text book work that you think I could handle, I should be glad if you would
let me know” (David Eugene Smith Professional Collection).

Seely continued living in Willseyville most of the rest of her life. She died in
1961 at age seventy-three in a nursing home in nearby Ithaca and was buried in
Woodland Cemetery in Delhi. She was survived by a niece, a nephew, and cousins.
