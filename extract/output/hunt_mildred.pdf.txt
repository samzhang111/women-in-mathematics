HUNT, Mildred. May 8, 1888–December 14, 1975.
Denison University (Shepardson College) (BA 1909), University of Chicago
(MA 1916, PhD 1924).

Mildred Hunt was born in Fairport, New York, the second of three children of
Helen (Metcalf) (b. 1855) and Horace Holmes Hunt (1852–1897), natives of New
York. The other children were Mary H. (b. 1885) and Horace Holmes (b. 1890). Her
father attended Rochester Theological Seminary and was ordained in 1879; he died
in Fairport at forty-ﬁve, when Mildred Hunt was nine years old. In 1900 Helen M.
Hunt was matron of Shepardson College for Women in Granville, Ohio. The college
became a part of Denison University that year. Mildred Hunt’s brother attended
Denison University, Columbia University, and Rochester Theological Seminary be-
fore being ordained and serving as a Baptist minister.

Mildred Hunt prepared for college in the preparatory department of Denison
University before attending the university as a student in Shepardson College (now
fully merged with Denison). After her graduation in 1909, she taught in Wood-
land College in Jonesboro, Arkansas, and at high schools in Brownsville, Ohio, and
Sistersville, West Virginia. She was an instructor of Latin and Greek at Hillsdale
College in Hillsdale, Michigan, 1912–15. During the academic year 1915–16, Hunt
studied at the University of Chicago, where she had courses in Analytic Mechanics
with Kurt Laves, Diﬀerential Equations and Deﬁnite Integrals with G. A. Bliss,
Elliptic Integrals with H. E. Slaught, Solid Analytic Geometry and Theory of Alge-
braic Invariants with L. E. Dickson, Diﬀerential Geometry with E. J. Wilczynski,
and Geometric Introduction to the Theory of the Complex Variable with A. C.
Lunn. Her master’s thesis was directed by Dickson, and the work for her master’s
degree was completed in August 1916.

After receiving her master’s degree, Hunt was an instructor of mathematics at
Parsons College (now closed) in Fairﬁeld, Iowa, 1916–17. She was professor of math-
ematics at Bessie Tift College (later Tift College, now closed), then a women’s col-
lege in Forsyth, Georgia, 1918–22. Tift College records indicate that she also taught
at Denison at some point, perhaps in 1917–18. She resumed her graduate studies
at Chicago, wrote her dissertation under Dickson, and received her PhD in 1924.

Hunt’s thirty-year career at Illinois Wesleyan University, in Bloomington, Illinois,
began in the fall of 1924. She joined the two-person department as assistant profes-
sor and was promoted to professor two years later, when the department’s previous
professor left. She was the senior member of the department, which consisted of
two people until a few years before her retirement.

While at Illinois Wesleyan, Hunt served on various university committees and
sometimes as freshman advisor. She was secretary of faculty in the College of Liberal
Arts after 1931 and assumed a major administrative position when she became
registrar of the university in 1943. She remained in both of these positions and
continued as professor of mathematics until she retired in 1954 as professor emeritus.
Until she became registrar Hunt regularly attended meetings of the Illinois Section
of the MAA and served as vice chairman 1939–40 and chairman 1940–41.

After her retirement, Mildred Hunt moved to Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, to live
with her family. Her death in 1975 at age eighty-seven in St. Petersburg, Florida,
came after a lengthy illness.
Organizational aﬃliations: AMS, MAA, AAAS, Phi Beta Kappa.
