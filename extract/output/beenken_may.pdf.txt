BEENKEN, May M. October 22, 1901–December 21, 1988.
University of California, Southern Branch (BEd 1923), University of Chicago
(MA 1926, PhD 1928).

May Margaret Beenken was the daughter of Sophie (Kirn) (1862–1941), born
in Pennsylvania, and Henry Beenken (b. 1852), born in Germany. She was born
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and had at least three older siblings: Daniel (ca.
1886–1954), a sister born in 1893, and Walter (1896–1959).

May Beenken attended public elementary school and three years of high school
in Philadelphia before the family moved to southern California. After one year there
she graduated from the Manual Arts High School of Los Angeles in 1919. She then
was a member of the ﬁrst class to receive bachelor’s degrees at the Southern Branch
of the University of California (now UCLA); she received a bachelor of education
degree in 1923.

Beenken taught in the public schools of Los Angeles 1923–24 and was an associate
in mathematics at the Southern Branch of the University of California 1924–25. She
entered the University of Chicago in the summer of 1925 and was in residence there,
except for summer quarter 1927, until June 1928, when she received her doctorate
with a dissertation in projective diﬀerential geometry. She was a university fellow
her last two years at Chicago and during that time served as chairman of the com-
mittee on arrangements and of the program committee of the Junior Mathematics
Club.

After receiving her PhD in 1928, Beenken joined the faculty at Oshkosh Teach-
ers College (now University of Wisconsin Oshkosh) as head of the mathematics
department and remained in that position for nineteen years. She was joined in
1929 by Irene Price. In February 1931 Beenken organized the mathematics club at
the college. She was in charge of mathematics for the US Air Force 96th column
training detachment at the college 1943–44, and was director of the division of
pre-professional education from 1944 until she left in 1947.

Beenken attended almost every meeting of the Wisconsin Section of the MAA
from its ﬁrst in April 1933 until she left the state in 1947; she served as secretary
in 1934–35 and chairman in 1943–44. She was active in other state organizations
as well; she was chairman in 1936–37 of the mathematics section of the Wisconsin
Education Association and was a member in the late 1930s of a state committee
on the uses and appreciation of mathematics.

Beenken was a lecturer at UCLA in the summer of 1945, and in 1947 returned to
southern California as associate professor of mathematics and department chairman
at Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles; she was promoted to professor in 1951.
During the summer of 1953 she attended an eight-week conference on collegiate
mathematics in Boulder, Colorado, that was sponsored by the National Science
Foundation. She received grants from the NSF for work at the University of Oregon
in summer 1954 and at UCLA in summer 1959 and from the Social Science Research
Council for work at Stanford in summer 1957. She retired from Immaculate Heart
College as emeritus professor in 1969.

Beenken died at age eighty-seven in 1988 at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los
Angeles. She was buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. In the
memorial note that appeared in the Immaculate Heart College Alumni Newsletter
after her death, a former student and colleague recalled that “she was indeed a

superb instructor, always prepared down to the minutest detail and utterly meticu-
lous in her comprehensive presentations” (p. 8). He added, “I remember once when
over 80% of her graduating mathematics majors were above the 90th percentile in
the nationwide Advanced Area Test in Mathematics – no students of Dr. Beenken’s
could ever say that they did not receive the best instruction that any educational
institution could ever oﬀer.” And, ﬁnally, “Dr. Beenken was at all times a creative
person, and when she retired from the College she decided to turn to painting. She
applied herself here with the same single-mindedness as in teaching” (p. 10).
