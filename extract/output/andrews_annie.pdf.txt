ANDREWS, Annie Dale (Biddle). December 13, 1885–April 14, 1940.
University of California (BA 1908, PhD 1911).

Annie Dale Biddle was born in Hanford, California, the youngest of seven sur-
viving children of Achsah A. (McQuiddy) (b. 1848) and Samuel Edward Biddle
(1845–1908). Her parents were both from Tennessee, married there in 1870, and
went to California and settled in Tulare County in 1874. Her father was a grain
dealer, later bank president and manager, and active in public service in Hanford.
The surviving children were three sons and four daughters: Tolbert Vance (1871–
1954), Eliza Jane (b. 1874), Samuel Edward Jr. (1876–1946), Reta H. (1879–1972),
Wallace Jeﬀerson (1882–1961), Kate Justina (1884–1984), and Annie Dale.

Biddle attended the University of California in Berkeley where she was a member
of Delta Gamma social sorority. After receiving her bachelor’s degree in 1908, she
was a University fellow in mathematics there in the academic years 1909–10 and
1910–11. As a student of pure mathematics she took courses in Synthetic Projective
Geometry, the area of her research, with D. N. Lehmer; Theory of Functions (of
a real variable, of a complex variable, and elliptic); Theory of Equations; Logic of
Mathematics; Theory of Substitutions and Groups of Polyhedra; Theory of Invari-
ants; Diﬀerential Geometry; and the Theory of Numbers. Her minor subject was
English literature, and a faculty member from that area served on the committee
for her ﬁnal examination for the PhD. Biddle’s 1911 doctorate was the third granted
by the California mathematics department, the ﬁrst to a woman.

The year after completing her work for the PhD, Biddle served as instructor of
mathematics at the University of Washington in Seattle. She then returned to the
Berkeley area and married, on October 7, 1912, William Samuel Andrews (1883–
1952), a native of California and an attorney who had received his LLB degree
from the University of California in 1906. A daughter, Wilhelmina Dale, was born
on September 4 the following year, and a son, William Samuel Jr., was born six
years later on July 20, 1919.

Annie D. B. Andrews continued her association with the University of Califor-
nia mathematics department after her marriage and taught while holding titles of
teaching fellow 1914–16, assistant in mathematics 1916–17, associate in mathemat-
ics 1920–23, and instructor 1924–33. In 1933 Andrews was one of six junior faculty
notiﬁed that they would not be reappointed because the department had decided
to concentrate more on its graduate program. As this was during the Great Depres-
sion, the department considered whether the loss of the position would produce a
signiﬁcant hardship. Andrews, who was married to a practicing attorney, was the
only one of the six who lost her job as of July 1, 1933. While she was on the faculty,
Andrews was involved with the Women’s Faculty Club, Torch and Shield, and Town
and Gown. Her husband noted soon after her death that “during the last few years
of her life in addition to running her home and doing mathematical research she
took an active interest in public aﬀairs and charitable work” (Owens questionnaire
1940).

After an illness of two years, Annie Andrews died in Oakland, California, in 1940

at ﬁfty-four. Her body was cremated.
