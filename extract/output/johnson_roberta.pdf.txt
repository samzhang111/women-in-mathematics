JOHNSON, Roberta F. January 22, 1902–October 12, 1988.
Wilson College (BA 1925), Cornell University (MA 1931, PhD 1933).

Roberta Frances Johnson was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the daugh-
ter of Mary Wallace (Abdill) (1874–1918) and Jesse B. Johnson (1875–1936). Her
mother was born in New Jersey, her father in Philadelphia. Her parents were ed-
ucated through grade school and married in about 1895. Johnson later described
her mother as a homemaker and her father as a mechanic; census records describe
his occupation as machinist. A sibling born before 1900 was not living in 1900. A
younger sister, Lillian, born about 1907, died at age three.

Roberta Frances Johnson attended Frankford High School in Philadelphia before
enrolling at Wilson College, a women’s college in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. At
Wilson she was a member of a literary club, the science club, and the international
relations club and was president of the latter her senior year. Upon graduation from
Wilson in 1925 with departmental honors in mathematics and a minor in history,
she remained in Chambersburg three years, 1925–28, to teach mathematics at the
Chambersburg high school. She taught mathematics and history for the next two
years in the high school in Newfoundland, Pennsylvania.

Johnson attended summer sessions at Cornell University during 1929 and 1930.
She remained at Cornell in the fall of 1930 and enrolled with a fellowship from
Wilson College intending to major in mathematics and minor in modern European
history. In February 1931 she received her master’s degree with both her major
and minor in mathematics. She retained the fellowship from Wilson during her
three years at Cornell and also held an Erastus Brooks fellowship her second year
there. After a third year of study at Cornell, with major subject geometry, ﬁrst
minor analysis, and second minor philosophy, she received her doctorate in 1933
with a dissertation in algebraic geometry directed by Virgil Snyder. Her published
dissertation, 1934, was described by Snyder in a review of a French monograph
as “an excellent introduction to this memoir” (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 41 (1935):
170).

Johnson had expected to remain at Cornell 1933–34 as a “resident doctor” in
order to continue her research. However, the head of the mathematics department
at Wilson became ill, and Johnson was to substitute for at least a month beginning
in September. When the head took a leave of absence, Johnson remained for the
academic year 1933–34 on a temporary appointment. Johnson taught at Wilson for
twenty-ﬁve years. She was an instructor 1934–35, assistant professor 1935–44, and
associate professor after 1944. During this time she taught all of the undergraduate
courses and honors courses. She was acting head of the department second semester
1944–45 and became department head in 1946 when the previous chairman retired.
After receiving her doctorate, Johnson stayed active in the mathematical com-
munity. She attended many local and national meetings of the American Mathe-
matical Society in the eastern United States, from Durham, North Carolina, north
to Providence, Rhode Island. In 1951 she served as a referee for one of the AMS
publications. During the summer of 1957, Johnson participated in a summer in-
stitute in social sciences for college mathematics teachers at Stanford University.
While at the institute she asked for a letter of recommendation from Robert J.
Walker, a Cornell faculty member whom she had seen at meetings of the Amer-
ican Mathematical Society. She wrote, “This spring I decided, after 24 years at

Wilson College to make a change. This has not been an easy decision to reach–it
should have been made twelve years ago when the former head retired. Unfortu-
nately those of us who launched our careers in the midst of the depression have a
false notion about security. Also, this will be my ﬁrst experience in job hunting.
Previously the job or fellowship hunted me” (Cornell University, Department of
Mathematics ﬁles). She continued, “I am prepared to adjust to a new pattern of
work and I expect to follow rather than lead in a new position. If necessary, I am
ready to leave the teaching ﬁeld but I believe that I have the most to contribute
in an academic position. However, I deﬁnitely desire to move to a co-educational
institution. . . . I shall not bore you with the details of my reasons for this decision.
My fellow faculty members will view it as a refusal to accept the injustice of being
passed over when promotions are made. It is not that alone. I need a change . . . ”
In a letter the following spring, she wrote that Wilson found out about her search,
and she received a promotion to full professor and a tenure contract. However, she
continued to look for a new position.

In 1958 Johnson moved to Fort Collins, Colorado, as an associate professor at
Colorado State University. While there she directed the theses of about eight mas-
ter’s students. Johnson remained at Colorado State until her retirement as asso-
ciate professor emeritus in 1967. The following spring the University of Colorado
announced her appointment as an associate professor, and she taught at the Uni-
versity of Colorado at Denver for three years after her retirement.

Johnson indicated in 1985 that she was a Presbyterian until 1925 and had no
religious aﬃliation after that. In summer 1936 she was in Ann Arbor as a reader for
the College Entrance Board; in September of that year she traveled to Bermuda.
During World War II, she did sewing for the Red Cross. She was also a member of
a Wilson College alumnae club. In the mid-1980s she listed reading as a hobby.

Roberta Johnson died of bone cancer in 1988 at age eighty-six at her home in
Fort Collins. During her illness she was cared for by friends and by a local hospice
organization, to which she bequeathed her house. Her remaining assets were given
to the Fort Collins public library. She was cremated and had requested that there
be no memorial service.
