BUSHEY, Jewell (Hughes). March 13, 1896–May 5, 1989.
University of Arkansas (BA 1915), University of Missouri (MA 1916), Univer-
sity of Chicago (PhD 1924).

Jewell Constance Hughes was the the ﬁfth of six children of Cora A. (Stanley) (b.
1867), originally from Missouri, and James R. Hughes (b. 1862), a native of Indiana.
She was born in Fayetteville, Arkansas, where her father was a merchant in 1900,
an operator of a sawmill in 1910, and later a timberman and sawmill operator. The
other children were Leslie Claire (1887–1971), Verda (1889–1985), Harry (b. 1892),
Anna (1894–1975), and Donald (b. 1899).

Jewell Hughes attended public elementary school 1901–08 in Fayetteville and
Fayetteville High School 1908–11. She entered the University of Arkansas in 1911
at age ﬁfteen, became a member of Chi Omega social sorority, and graduated in
1915. She immediately received a scholarship at the University of Missouri, where
she studied mathematics with E. R. Hedrick, O. D. Kellogg, and Louis Ingold in
1915–16 and received her master’s degree in 1916.

Hughes taught for two years at the Columbia, Missouri, high school before re-
turning to the University of Arkansas in 1918 as instructor of mathematics. She
remained at Arkansas until 1930: as instructor 1918–24, assistant professor 1924–
27, and associate professor 1927–30. She was granted a leave of absence for the
academic year 1923–24 for study at the University of Chicago. Hughes studied
under E. H. Moore, G. A. Bliss, L. E. Dickson, F. R. Moulton, and Mayme I. Logs-
don at Chicago, ﬁrst in the summer quarters 1920–23 and then in the following
four quarters; she was a teaching fellow 1923–24. She wrote her dissertation in the
calculus of variations before receiving her PhD magna cum laude in August 1924.
While continuing to teach at the University of Arkansas, Hughes did further
study at the University of California in summer 1925 and at the University of
Chicago summer 1927. She traveled in Europe in the summer of 1928. Later post-
doctoral study included a course at Columbia University during 1934 and work at
the University of Chicago in summer 1938.

In 1930 Hughes joined the faculty at Hunter College as assistant professor. She
was assured at the time of the oﬀer that she would be promoted to associate pro-
fessor, her rank at the University of Arkansas, in a short time. An attitude she
expressed at a dinner talk at the December 1927 mathematics meetings may par-
tially explain why she left Arkansas. “Miss Jewell Hughes told of the opportunities
for women in the teaching of mathematics in the United States, aﬃrming and sub-
stantiating the statement that women have an opportunity equal with that of men
in college and university positions unless it be in the higher university positions”
(Amer. Math. Monthly 35 (1928): 103). Hughes remained at Hunter the rest of her
career: as assistant professor 1930–39, as associate professor 1939–51, as professor
1951–66, and as professor emeritus after her retirement at age seventy.

On June 24, 1935, Jewell Hughes and Joseph Hobart Bushey, a colleague at
Hunter College, were married at the home of her brother, Leslie C. Hughes, in
Elizabeth, New Jersey. J. Hobart Bushey (December 19, 1903–November 25, 1976),
originally from Baltimore, had received his BS from the Johns Hopkins University
in 1924 and his MA and PhD in mathematics from the University of Michigan in
1928 and 1930, respectively. He had also joined the mathematics department at

Hunter College as an assistant professor in 1930. He was promoted to associate
professor in 1936 and to professor in 1953. He retired at age seventy.

In 1940 Jewell H. Bushey was elected chairman of the mathematics department
at Hunter replacing Lao G. Simons who retired in June of that year. In addition
to her teaching and administrative work, Bushey was extremely active in college
service and in organizations at the college. She was a member of college committees
concerned with the curriculum, with student-faculty relations, with faculty-board
relations, and with adult education, among others. During 1943–50 she was chair-
man of the executive committee of the faculty. For the Hunter chapter of AAUP,
she was treasurer part of 1936–37, vice president 1937–38, and president 1938–40.
She was also president for several years of the Hunter Phi Beta Kappa chapter and
was director at times of the local Pi Mu Epsilon chapter. During the summer of
1959 she directed an NSF institute for junior and senior high school teachers.

Jewell Hughes Bushey was active in a number of professional organizations at the
national level, as well. As early as December 1925, when she was an assistant pro-
fessor at the University of Arkansas, she gave the ﬁrst of her many dinner speeches
at joint meetings of the AMS and MAA. This ﬁrst speech was a recollection of her
recent time as a graduate student at the University of Chicago. A December 1929
speech was described as “replete with wit” (Amer. Math. Monthly 37 (1930): 107),
while a 1951 speech was “about the past and present status of women mathemati-
cians, stating certain theorems on this subject” (Amer. Math. Monthly 59 (1952):
208). The last dinner speech she made that was described in the Monthly was forty
years after the ﬁrst; this speech was made on behalf of her fellow charter members
of the MAA at the ﬁftieth anniversary meeting in August 1965. She also spoke at
the 1937 luncheon organized by Helen B. Owens that honored women pioneers in
mathematical research in America.

Between her ﬁrst and last speeches, Bushey served the MAA in various ways:
she was on several program committees for national meetings, was chairman of
the Metropolitan New York Section 1944–45, was national second vice president
1951–52, was governor from the Metropolitan New York Section 1957–60, and was
on the committee on secondary school lecturers 1961–63. She was also an advocate
for faculty and in 1940 was appointed to an AAUP committee to investigate the
dismissal of ﬁve faculty members from Adelphi University. She was a member of
the AAUP national council 1942–44 and of its executive committee 1942–43. She
was a member of a joint committee of AAUP and the Association of American
Colleges on tenure and retirement in 1943. She served as a national vice president
of the AAUP 1944–46, was a member of the committee on the economic status of
the profession 1948, was chairman of the nominating committee for national oﬃcers
for 1948–50, and was on the board of the Bulletin of the AAUP in 1951.

In June 1949 Jewell Bushey was awarded an honorary LLD degree from the
University of Arkansas, the second woman to receive that degree from Arkansas. The
Jewell Hughes Bushey scholarship for proﬁciency in mathematics was established
by the Hunter College Pi Mu Epsilon chapter the year she retired.

After J. Hobart Bushey retired from Hunter in 1972, the Busheys moved back
to Fayetteville, Arkansas. He died four years later, shortly before his seventy-third
birthday. Jewell Bushey continued to live in Fayetteville until her death at a local
hospital in 1989 at age ninety-three. She was survived by a nephew in New Jersey.
