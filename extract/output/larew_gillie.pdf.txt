LAREW, Gillie A. July 28, 1882–January 2, 1977.
Randolph-Macon Woman’s College (BA 1903), University of Chicago (MS
1911, PhD 1916).

Gillie Aldah Larew was born near Newbern, in Pulaski County, Virginia, the
daughter of Gillie Augusta (Glendy) (1846–1887) and Isaac Hall Larew (1840–1904),
both natives of Virginia. Her father had served as a captain in the Confederate
army during the Civil War. Her parents married on February 12, 1867. She had
four older siblings, John Glendy (1869–1876), Mary Alma Lyle (1872–1875), Cyrus
Guy (1875–1908), and Robert Joseph (1877–1880), only one of whom was living at
the time of her birth; she also had a younger sister, Julia (b. 1884). Her father was
a farmer and a lawyer; he married a second time in about 1890 and had ﬁve more
children. A later tribute indicated that she was “reared in a Christian home in an
atmosphere of liberal Presbyterianism” and that “the place in the family’s daily
worship given to the great hymns of the Church and the Christian message” was
important to her (Lipscomb 1953, 34).

Gillie Larew received her primary and secondary education from private tutors
before entering Randolph-Macon Woman’s College in Lynchburg, Virginia, in Sep-
tember 1899, near the end of the college’s ﬁrst decade. (The college was renamed
Randolph College in July 2007 and became coeducational in September 2007.) Im-
mediately after Larew’s graduation in 1903 she became an instructor in mathemat-
ics there. She attended courses in the mathematics department at the University of
Chicago in the summers of 1906 and 1909 and in the spring and summer quarters
of 1911. She wrote her master’s thesis in mechanics to complete the work for her
master’s degree in 1911.

Larew continued at Randolph-Macon Woman’s College, except for leaves, for the
remainder of her career. Having been made adjunct professor in 1909, she returned
to the University of Chicago for seven quarters during the years 1914–16. She was a
fellow in 1915–16, wrote her dissertation in the calculus of variations, and received
her PhD in 1916. She returned to Randolph-Macon Woman’s College and was
promoted to associate professor in 1918 and to professor in 1921. She served as
acting head of the department for a year in the early 1920s.

Apparently at the suggestion of G. A. Bliss, Larew’s dissertation advisor, she
spent the year 1929–30 in Munich studying mainly with Carath´eodory. In 1936 she
became head of the department at Randolph-Macon and remained so until 1950,
when that position went to M. Gweneth Humphreys, who had been hired from
Newcomb College the year before, when Larew had become dean of the college.
Larew became dean emeritus and professor emeritus upon her retirement in 1953,
at age seventy. After her retirement she served on the college steering committee
and helped with the alumnae development program. In 1952, shortly before her
retirement, she presented her personal philosophy on the Edward R. Murrow radio
program “This I believe.” These views appeared the following year in an article,
“But as for me. . . ,” in the AAUW Journal. The article was described as: “A fellow
Virginian borrows Patrick Henry’s famous words to introduce some thoughts on
nonconformity” (1954, 3).

Larew was active in a number of professional organizations. In the 1920s she
served as secretary of the Mathematics Section of the Virginia Educational Con-
ference. After joining the MAA as a charter member, she attended many national

meetings of the MAA and meetings of the Maryland-District of Columbia-Virginia
Section, for which she was on the executive committee in the early 1930s and was
chairman 1937–38; she served as regional governor from July 1945 to July 1947.
Larew served on the research committee of the Virginia Academy of Science in the
early 1940s and was elected to the council in 1945. She was also very active in
the AAUW and served as president of the local branch in 1922 and president of
the state division 1938–40. The biographical notes to Larew’s 1954 article say that
“her services to AAUW have been too numerous for listing here. She is presently a
member of the Standards and Recognition Committee, having recently completed
four years as Vice-President from the South Atlantic Region” (p. 3).

Larew’s contributions to Randolph-Macon Woman’s College were recognized in
several ways. In 1948 the college alumnae association endowed the Gillie A. Larew
Chair of Mathematics. In June 1953 she was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor
of Humane Letters by the college, and that month’s issue of the Alumnae Bulletin
was dedicated to her. In 1968 the Gillie Aldah Larew Distinguished Teaching Award
was established by a member of the class of 1916 and her husband. An obituary
in the Alumnae Bulletin noted that she was “the ﬁrst alumna to be made a full
professor at R-MWC, . . . the ﬁrst alumna to head a department at the College, . . .
[and] the ﬁrst person to receive an honorary degree . . . from the R-MWC” (“We
Mourn Dr. Gillie A. Larew”).

Gillie Larew died at her home in Lynchburg, Virginia, in 1977. She was ninety-
four. She was survived by two half-sisters, nieces, and nephews, and was buried in
the Larew Cemetery near her birthplace in Pulaski County, Virginia.
