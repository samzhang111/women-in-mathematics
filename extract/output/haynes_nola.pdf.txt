HAYNES, Nola (Anderson). January 9, 1897–December 21, 1996.
University of Missouri (BS 1922, MA 1926, PhD 1929).

Nola Lee Anderson was the second of ﬁve children of Mary Estella (Swan) (1866–
1946) and Edward Lee Anderson (1867–1945), a farmer. Her mother was born in
Michigan, while her father, she, and her siblings were born in or near Bucklin in Linn
County in north-central Missouri. Both parents had an elementary school education;
they were married in 1894. Nola Anderson’s older sister, Mary Ellen (1895–1918),
had contracted polio when an infant. Her only brother, Morton Albert (1899–1967),
received a high school education and became a farmer. Her younger sisters, Selma
Lucille (1909–1996) and Elma Peach (b. 1911), both received bachelor’s degrees
from the University of Missouri. Selma Anderson became a teacher and homemaker,
while Elma Anderson received a second bachelor’s degree in library science from
the University of Illinois and was a librarian.

Nola Anderson received her early education in a one-room schoolhouse and grad-
uated from the high school in Bucklin in 1915. In 1981 she described her early
education. “My father would buy corn and ship cattle. He had me do a lot of the
adding and ﬁguring . . . and I liked it. I liked, of course, the arithmetic at school. I
went to a very small town high school that was just a two-year high school when
I started. But they added on the junior year and the senior year . . . and I was in
the ﬁrst [four-year] graduating class. . . . Then the pattern of the day was you took
examinations to get certiﬁcates and you could go out and teach in the rural schools.
So I did that and taught for four years at a rural school” (Smithsonian meeting
tapes).

Anderson enrolled at the University of Missouri in the fall of 1919, at the age
of twenty-two, and graduated three years later with a BS in education. She taught
mathematics for two years at the high school in St. Charles, Missouri; the following
year she had charge of the mathematics department at Central College for Women,
a junior college in Lexington, Missouri. She then returned to the University of Mis-
souri to study mathematics and astronomy and received her MA after one year. She
continued her graduate studies as a university scholar in mathematics in 1926–27,
as a Gregory scholar in 1927–28, and as an instructor in 1928–29. Her dissertation
committee consisted of her advisor, Louis Ingold, a 1907 Chicago PhD, and W. D.
A. Westfall, G. E. Wahlin, and E. S. Haynes, who represented her minor ﬁeld of
astronomy. Anderson remained at the University of Missouri as an instructor for
one more year after receiving her doctorate in 1929.

In 1930 Anderson joined the faculty at H. Sophie Newcomb College, Tulane Uni-
versity, in New Orleans as associate professor and acting chair of the department.
She remained for the next eight years as associate professor 1930–36 and as pro-
fessor 1936–38; she also served as department chair during her years at Newcomb.
In her ﬁrst years at Newcomb College, Anderson supervised a master’s thesis in
geometry. She became active in the Louisiana-Mississippi Section of the MAA and
served as secretary 1931–32 and vice chairman for Louisiana 1937–38.

When Anderson went to Newcomb in 1930, Anna Mayme Howe had just left
after eleven years as an assistant professor, and Marie J. Weiss had just arrived
as an assistant professor. During 1934–35 Weiss was on leave to spend the year
at Bryn Mawr College working with Emmy Noether, and Anderson hired Vera
Ames (Widder) as her replacement for the year. In 1936 Weiss left for an assistant

professorship at Vassar College, and Anderson hired M. Gweneth Humphreys as
an instructor to replace Weiss. When Anderson left Newcomb in 1938, Marie Weiss
returned as professor and mathematics department head.

While at Newcomb, Anderson remained in contact with E. S. Haynes, who had
served on her dissertation committee. Eli Stuart Haynes, born in Missouri in 1880,
received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the University of Missouri in 1905
and 1907, respectively, and his PhD in astronomy from the University of California
in 1913. After nearly a decade at Beloit College he returned to the University of
Missouri in 1923 as professor of astronomy and director of the Laws Observatory.
After nearly twenty-six years of marriage and with two grown sons, Haynes was
widowed in 1934. Nola Anderson left Newcomb College at the end of the 1937–38
school year and married Haynes on July 9, 1938. Her marriage was announced in
the October 1938 issue of the Monthly.

Nola Anderson Haynes then moved to Columbia, Missouri. She described her

expectations and experiences there in 1981.

When I left Newcomb College I left to get married to the chairman
of the astronomy department of the University of Missouri. There
was a very strict nepotism law and I was giving up my career for
marriage, thinking I would never teach again. Then when the Sec-
ond World War came on . . . I was the ﬁrst person called back into
teaching. At that time they didn’t set any salaries and they gave me
the name of acting instructor or something like that because of the
nepotism law. I thought it was a temporary sort of thing and then
after the war the boys came back and I was still an acting associate
professor . . . because of my husband. It was not until my husband
retired that I got the appointment of associate professor. . . . There
was a very strict nepotism law at the University of Missouri; not
only did it include wives, but if you had a niece or a cousin on staﬀ
- only one could be on the staﬀ. (Smithsonian meeting tapes)

In 1943–44 she was a special instructor; from 1946 to 1951 she served as acting
associate professor; and in 1951, after her husband’s retirement in 1950, she became
the ﬁrst woman at the University of Missouri to hold the title of associate professor
of mathematics. In 1952 she was elected to a one-year term as secretary-treasurer
of the Missouri Section of the MAA. She served again as secretary-treasurer of the
section 1960–63 and chairman 1963–64.

E. S. Haynes died in 1956, and Nola Haynes continued teaching until her retire-
ment as emeritus associate professor in 1967, at age seventy. During her last years
of teaching at Missouri she taught honors sections and, in 1959, participated in a
panel discussion at a joint meeting of the NCTM and NEA on “Helping the better
pupil toward higher goals.” After her retirement she served one year, 1967–68, as
professor at Randolph-Macon Woman’s College (now Randolph College), where her
former colleague M. Gweneth Humphreys chaired the department.

Nola Haynes was a member of Pi Lambda Theta, an education honor society.
She was also a member of the National Society of Colonial Dames of America and
was listed on their Honor Roll in 1980. Locally, she served as president of the Boone
County League of Women Voters and was a member of the Fortnightly Club and
Readers’ Club of Columbia. She was also a member of the First Christian Church
in Columbia, where she was an honorary deaconess. She established the Eli Stuart

Haynes and Nola Anderson Haynes Scholarship Fund at Missouri and in 1995 was
awarded the ﬁrst College of Arts and Science Silver Chalk Award for contributions
in teaching.

Nola Haynes died in Brookﬁeld, Missouri, in December 1966, less than three
weeks before her hundredth birthday. She was survived by her youngest sister, of
nearby Marceline, Missouri, and a stepson of Port Angeles, Washington. She was
buried in Memorial Park Cemetery, Columbia, Missouri.
