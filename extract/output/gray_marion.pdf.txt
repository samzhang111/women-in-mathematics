GRAY, Marion C. March 26, 1902–September 16, 1979.
University of Edinburgh (MA 1922), Bryn Mawr College (PhD 1926).

Marion Cameron Gray was born in Ayr, Scotland, the daughter of Marion
(Cameron) and James Gray. She attended Ayr Grammar School (1907–13) and
Ayr Academy (1913–19) before matriculating at the University of Edinburgh in
1919. At the time of her matriculation she indicated that she was a member of the
United Free Church of Scotland.

In 1922 Gray received her master’s degree, the ﬁrst degree given in universities
in Scotland at that time, with ﬁrst class honors in mathematics and natural phi-
losophy. She remained at Edinburgh another two years as a post-graduate student
in mathematics. While at Edinburgh she studied with E. T. Whittaker, whom she
credited with ﬁrst arousing her interest in mathematics.

Gray came to the United States in 1924 to study at Bryn Mawr College. At Bryn
Mawr she held a British graduate scholarship and a Carnegie research scholarship.
While at Bryn Mawr, she studied with Anna Pell Wheeler, David V. Widder, Mar-
guerite Lehr in mathematics and James Barnes in physics before receiving her PhD
in 1926 having written a dissertation in analysis and with allied subject physics. In
December 1925, Barnes had written a letter of recommendation to the president of
the University of Saskatchewan indicating that Gray was hoping to remain in the
United States or Canada.

After receiving her doctorate, Gray returned to Great Britain, where she was a
university assistant in natural philosophy at the the University of Edinburgh for one
year and an assistant in mathematics at the Imperial College of Science in London
for three years.

In 1930 she returned to the United States and was hired as an assistant engineer
in the development and research department of American Telephone and Telegraph
Company. She published two papers relevant to her work in the journal Physics,
later to become the Journal of Applied Physics. In about 1932 she discovered what
has become known as the Gray graph while “looking for what we called completely
symmetric networks” (Gray to Bouwer, July 10, 1969). Although she never pub-
lished anything about this graph, Izak Z. Bouwer learned of her work on the graph
and mentioned it in his 1968 paper “An edge but not vertex transitive cubic graph”
(Canad. Math. Bull. 11:533–35). In June 1969, he wrote to Gray of his “apprecia-
tion of the fact that at a time when graph theory was almost nonexistent, you had
already found this graph with its interesting properties.” The graph is discussed
in “Gray Graph” from Wolfram MathWorld by Eric W. Weisstein, and in “Gray
Graph” from Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.

In 1934 she joined the technical staﬀ of Bell Telephone Laboratories where she
worked for more than thirty years, ﬁrst in New York City and then in Murray Hill,
New Jersey. While there, Gray published several more articles and contributed to
the ﬁeld of mathematical physics in other ways as well. In addition to writing
book reviews in journals, she aided other authors and was acknowledged for her
helpful discussions and for her computations. She also wrote 258 reviews in the
ﬁrst fourteen volumes of Mathematical Reviews. In 1954 Gray served on an ad
hoc committee formed when the National Science Foundation asked the National
Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology) to
prepare a handbook of mathematical tables. The outcome of that project was the

GRAY, M. C. - 2

Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical
Tables published in 1964. For her entry in the twelfth edition of American Men
and Women of Science, she indicated her research interests as wave propagation
over the spherical earth, mathematical theory of antenna radiation, propagation
of waves in loaded wave guides, and numerical analysis. One hundred forty of her
reviews in MR were classiﬁed as “optics, electromagnetic theory, circuits,” while
another 52 were classiﬁed as “special functions.”

In the 1930s, Gray lived in New York City and later in East Orange, New Jersey.
She became a naturalized United States citizen in 1937. After her retirement in
1967, Gray returned to Edinburgh, where she died at age seventy-seven in 1979.
