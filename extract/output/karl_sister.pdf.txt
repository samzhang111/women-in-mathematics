KARL, Sister Mary Cordia. November 16, 1893–August 30, 1984.
Hunter College (BA 1916), Johns Hopkins University (MA 1927, PhD 1931).

Elizabeth E. Mary Karl was born in New York City, the eldest of four children
of Mary Anna (Klarmann) (b. 1866) and Edward Philip Karl (b. 1865), both born
in New York of German parents. Her father was an oﬃce clerk. In 1900 the family
was living in the Bronx, and her parents had been married eight years. At that
time there were three children: Elizabeth; Mary [Marie] (b. 1897), and Nicholas (b.
1899). Their daughter Frances was born in about 1901.

Elizabeth Karl attended Immaculate Conception School for eight years and then
Normal College High School (later Hunter College High School) 1908–12. After her
high school graduation she attended Hunter College, from which she graduated
second in her class in January 1916 with a major in mathematics and minors in
astronomy and physics. The lighthearted description of her in her college yearbook
noted that “in spite of many years spent in this Institution of Learning, Elizabeth
has not overcome her primitive fondness for folk-dancing. We think the reason is
that she never tried” (Wisterion 1916, 30). It was later reported that she hoped to
become a nun after graduation but that her father objected strongly. Karl taught in
the New York City schools until 1918. She taught algebra and English at William
Cullen Bryant High School in Long Island City, Queens, February 1916–February
1917; mathematics at Blessed Sacrament Academy in Manhattan February 1916–
June 1917; and third grade at Public School 46 in the Bronx 1917–18.

In 1918 Elizabeth Karl entered the Order of the School Sisters of Notre Dame,
whose motherhouse is in Baltimore, and took the name Mary Cordia. For most
of the time from 1918 until her retirement in 1965, Sister Mary Cordia Karl was
associated with the College of Notre Dame of Maryland, in Baltimore, a Roman
Catholic women’s college, which was established in 1873 and which granted its ﬁrst
bachelor’s degree in 1899. She taught mathematics and education at the college
1918–20; mathematics, science, Latin, and history at Notre Dame High School in
Baltimore, 1920–22; and mathematics and physics at the College of Notre Dame
after September 1922.

In 1920 a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was established at Hunter College, and the
following year Sister Mary Cordia Karl was oﬀered membership by the new chapter.
However, as a novice she was unable to accept the invitation. In 1948 her election
was reaﬃrmed and was announced by the Hunter College chapter president, Jewell
Hughes Bushey.

During most of the period from 1923 until 1931 Sister Mary Cordia was engaged
in graduate work: in summer 1923 she studied at Fordham University; in fall 1923
she entered Johns Hopkins University, where she studied, usually part time, most of
the next eight years. She took courses in physics in 1923–24, chemistry in 1924–25,
and chemistry and mathematics in 1925–26. She also studied during the summers of
1925 and 1926 and during the academic year 1926–27. In June of 1927 she received
a master’s degree, based on her course work and on a master’s essay on ﬁnite
diﬀerences. She resumed her graduate work at Johns Hopkins in 1929 and ﬁnished
her work for the PhD in 1931 with a dissertation, in which she used methods of
projective geometry to recast a theory of orthopoles, written under the direction of
Oscar Zariski, who had arrived at Johns Hopkins from Rome four years earlier and

who was not until some years later to introduce abstract algebra so decisively into
his algebraic geometry.

Sister Cordia became head of the mathematics department at the College of
Notre Dame in 1922, and in 1939 she hired one of her former students, Mary
Varnhorn, to teach there. Karl remained as head of the department until 1965. She
was also the religious leader of the nuns at the college from 1959 to 1965. It appears
that in 1964–65 she was not teaching but served as coordinator of the science
building planning project. After her retirement in September 1965 she moved to
the Notre Dame Preparatory School in Towson, Maryland, where she taught and
served as ﬁnancial oﬃcer and then as administrative assistant until her second
retirement in 1982. Later she lived at Villa Assumpta and the Maria Health Care
Center for retired and ill sisters.

Sister Mary Cordia Karl died at St. Joseph Hospital in Baltimore at age ninety
in August 1984. In 1994 the ﬁrst of the Sister Cordia Karl Mathematics Awards
was conferred by the faculty of the mathematics department on an outstanding
mathematics student. In 2004 an award was made by the National Science Founda-
tion to fund a four-year program, The Cordia Karl Scholars Program, to support
students studying computer science, computer information systems, engineering, or
mathematics at the College of Notre Dame of Maryland.
