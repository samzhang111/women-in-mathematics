SULLIVAN, Sister M. Helen. April 10, 1907–December 22, 1998.
St. Benedict’s College (BA 1930), Catholic University of America (MA 1931,
PhD 1934).

Monica Elizabeth Sullivan was the fourth of nine children of Mary E. (Majerus) (1876–
1947) and John Edward Sullivan (b. 1873), both from Rulo in the southeastern corner
of Nebraska. Her mother graduated from high school in nearby Falls City; her father
attended Nebraska State Normal School (now Peru State College) and St. Benedict’s
College in Atchison, Kansas. He was a teacher for eight years before becoming a banker,
land owner, and community leader in Kansas. Her parents were married in 1897 and lived
in Rulo until after the birth of their second son in 1903. The family then moved across the
state line to Eﬃngham, Kansas, where the seven youngest children were born. The other
children in the family were: Paul Justin (1899–1950), Leo Bernard (1903–1978), Nellie
C. (1905–1980), Edward Stephen (b. 1909), Agnes (1912–1987), Mary Margaret (Sister
Bede) (1915–1993), Rita (b. 1917), and Teresa Catherine (b. 1920). Of these, all had some
college education, one became a priest, and one became a Benedictine Sister.

Elizabeth Sullivan attended parochial schools in Kansas: in Eﬃngham 1913–19, at St.
Peter’s parish grade school in Mercier 1919–20, and at Mount St. Scholastica Academy
in Atchison 1921–25. After graduating as class valedictorian in 1925, she attended Mount
St. Scholastica Junior College 1926–28 and then St. Benedict’s College 1928–30. Mount
St. Scholastica did not grant degrees as a senior college until 1932.

Sullivan joined the Benedictine Sisters in 1925, professed into the Order of St. Benedict
in 1930, and as Sister Mary Helen Sullivan continued her studies at the Catholic University
of America. In 1981 she described the situation at that time.

As a young sister, just as I was ﬁnishing college, my superior called me
and said she would like me to go into physics, and I said, “physics?” Then
she said, “Well, what do you like?” And I said, “Well, I like languages
and philosophy.” She said, “Well, we need somebody in physics.” So I
said, “Well, okay I’ll give it a try.” So I went to Catholic University and
I got my master’s in physics in ’31. I learned, meanwhile, that you build
your own equipment and you do this sort of thing. It wasn’t very enticing
to think I was going to be engaging in building equipment when I got
this degree. So I talked to her and also I got ill for a period in there,
and I think she realized that probably this was going to be too much of
a strain. So, we talked to the dean of the graduate school and . . . it was
no problem to switch me over to math. (Smithsonian meeting tapes)

Three years after receiving her master’s degree, she earned her doctorate in mathemat-
ics with a dissertation directed by Aubrey E. Landry and with a minor in physics and
mechanics.

After receiving her PhD in 1934, Sister M. Helen Sullivan returned to Mount St. Scholas-
tica College, where she had taught in the summer of 1931. She reported in 1981 that “one
of the advantages of going into a religious community is you don’t have to seek your jobs;
I was assigned. I came home with my degree and started teaching everything in the pro-
gram that I could handle. I taught ﬁfteen hours my ﬁrst year and believe you me it wasn’t
easy. It is probably one of the reasons I had to have sick leave. . . (Smithsonian meeting
tapes 1981). Emma Olson replaced her and served as acting head of the department sec-
ond semester 1934–35, and M. Gweneth Humphreys replaced Sister Helen as head of the
department 1935–36. Sister Helen was away during two more early periods because of
illness.

Sister Helen remained at the college, except for leaves, sabbaticals, and other experi-
ences, until 1970, after which Mount St. Scholastica and St. Benedict’s oﬃcially merged to

become Benedictine College. She was instructor 1934–37, assistant professor 1938–45, pro-
fessor 1945–70, and professor emeritus after 1970. Sister Jo Ann Fellin, retired Benedictine
College faculty member, relayed to one of the authors that in addition to two sabbatical
leaves at universities, Sister Helen was away 1937–38, 1945–46, and 1954–57, and that at
two intervals she “was assigned to administrative work as principal in Louisiana, Iowa,
and Kansas.”

Sister Helen was chairman of the mathematics department 1934–54 and after her re-
turn from a three-year leave in 1957; she was chairman of the division of mathematics and
natural sciences 1963–70. In about 1936 she organized Euclid’s Circle, the mathematics
club that preceded the founding by her in 1940 of the Kansas Gamma chapter of Kappa
Mu Epsilon. In 1981 Sister Helen wrote that, “my entire teaching career has been both
successful and happy. Of special signiﬁcance to me was my Undergraduate Research Pro-
gram funded by N.S.F. [1963–67]. Because of this, students of mine had eighteen published
papers. Our mathematics program was an Honors Program and we have many Master’s
Degrees and seven or eight doctorates. This, I feel, is unusual for a small liberal arts college
for women in the mid-West” (Smithsonian questionnaire). Furthermore, during her last
few years there, Sullivan was the campus coordinator of the junior year abroad program
for the Institute of European Studies.

During the period Sister Helen was at Mount St. Scholastica College, she engaged in
post-doctoral study, held a number of visiting positions, and participated in various na-
tional professional organizations. She engaged in research and study at Universit´e Laval,
Quebec City, Canada, summer 1950; the University of Oklahoma, Norman, summer 1962;
and Clare College, Cambridge University, England, summer 1964. She was a visiting pro-
fessor at Loyola University (then referred to as Loyola University of the South and now
oﬃcially Loyola University New Orleans) 1948–49 and summer 1949. During that summer
she taught using her notes, “The Christian Approach to Science: A Philosophic Integration
for Science Majors in Liberal Arts Colleges.” A copy of these typewritten notes is among
the papers Sullivan donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1981. In the summers of
1953 and 1954 she was a visiting professor at Fort Smith Junior College (now University of
Arkansas Fort Smith), and in summer 1968 she was also a visiting professor at Wesleyan
University in Connecticut.

Sullivan was an NSF visiting lecturer in the graduate school of the University of Detroit
in summers 1960 and 1963 and taught in NSF summer institutes at Rosary Hill College
in Buﬀalo, New York, in 1965, and at Claﬂin University, a historically black university
in Orangeburg, South Carolina, in 1965 and 1966. Also in 1966 she took a course at
Rockhurst College in Kansas City, Missouri, and participated in workshops at Argonne
National Laboratory near Lemont, Illinois, in order to be able to introduce a computer
course at Mount St. Scholastica. She was visiting professor at the University of Minnesota
and, part time, at the College of St. Catherine in St. Paul, Minnesota, during 1964–65
while on sabbatical leave. While in Minnesota, Sullivan participated in the NSF sponsored
College Geometry Project as part of a textbook writing team.

During the 1960s Sullivan’s activities were reported in the Mount St. Scholastica Kappa

Mu Epsilon periodical The Exponent. The October 1965 issue noted that

Sister Helen spent six weeks this summer teaching in a N.S.F. Institute at
Claﬂin University . . . . She taught two sections of “Foundations of Mod-
ern Mathematics” to 65 Institute members, all of whom were Negroes.

When asked how she received this assignment, Sister Helen explained
that she had remarked last March in St. Paul that she would rather teach
the Negro than join in a “Sympathy-for-Selma” march. A few days later
she received a letter asking her to do just that at Claﬂin Univeristy. (p.

Among her many professional activities were several sponsored by NSF. In addition to
her involvement with the undergraduate research program at Mount St. Scholastica and
the visiting lectureships noted above, she was NSF visiting lecturer for high schools in
Kansas; she was a participant in three NSF institutes for college teachers of mathematics;
she was a member of an eight-person writing team at the University of Minnesota to
produce college geometry materials; and she served on NSF panels to read and evaluate
proposals in Washington, D.C.

Sister Helen was also active in mathematical organizations. Her work with MAA in-
cluded contributing to the Guidance Pamphlet issued by the Post-War Commission of the
MAA, serving on the state committee appointed by MAA to evaluate standards proposed
by CUPM for undergraduate mathematics programs, and serving as the vice chairman
of the Kansas Section 1946–47 and chairman 1947–48. She was often faculty sponsor of
the Mount St. Scholastica chapter of the mathematics honor society Kappa Mu Epsilon.
A scholarship was established in 1965 by the alumnae of the Kansas Gamma Chapter of
Kappa Mu Epsilon and named the Sister Helen Sullivan scholarship in her honor in 1967.
Her contributions to the national Kappa Mu Epsilon, which included serving as national
historian 1943–47 and as assistant editor of its journal Pentagon 1943–47 and 1961–70,
were ﬁrst recognized when she was named one of ﬁfty Distinguished Members of KME at
their ﬁftieth anniversary celebration in 1981. Ten years later KME honored her with the
George R. Mach Distinguished Service Award.

After Sullivan left Mount St. Scholastica College in 1970, she held a variety of teaching,
studying, and administrative positions both abroad and in this country. In the spring of
1970, as a member of an international curriculum committee of the Institute of European
Studies, she made on-site evaluations of study centers of some major European universities.
In the summer of 1970 she was an American consultant in mathematics for US AID at the
University of Aurangabad, India. This was followed by a year on sabbatical leave, 1970–71,
as visiting professor under the International Cultural Exchange in Ireland at University
College, Galway. The following year she was consultant, academic counselor, and tutor in
mathematics at the Institute of European Studies at the University of Vienna in Austria.
After returning to this country she served as director of development at Lillis High
School in Kansas City 1972–73 and as assistant director, Diocesan Oﬃce of Education in
Billings, Montana, 1973–75. The following year she engaged in graduate study in theology
at Gonzaga University in Seattle.

In 1976 Sister Helen moved to Berkeley, California, where she remained for most of the
next decade. While there she was research assistant to the dean and faculty, Jesuit School
of Theology, 1976–77; assistant to the president, Graduate Theological Union, 1977–78;
assistant to the president of the School of Applied Theology 1978–79; and development
research specialist for Catholic Charity Services in Oakland 1978–81. In the early 1980s, she
was a member of spiritual direction and retreat teams at the School of Applied Theology
in Berkeley.

Sister Helen Sullivan returned to Atchison, Kansas, in 1985 and lived in the Dooley
Center, a care facility at Mount St. Scholastica Monastery. She died there in 1998 at age
ninety-one. Burial was in the Sisters’ Cemetery.
