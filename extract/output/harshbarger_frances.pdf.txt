HARSHBARGER, Frances. August 16, 1902–February 11, 1987.
Grinnell College (BA 1923), West Virginia University (MA 1925), University
of Illinois (PhD 1930).

Frances Harshbarger was born in Quimby, Iowa, the middle child of Annie W.
(b. 1870) and Charles C. Harshbarger (b. 1871), both natives of Iowa. Two years
separated her from her older brother, Henry, and from her younger sister, Emily.
Her father was a bank cashier.

After graduating from Grinnell College in Iowa in 1923, Harshbarger was at
West Virginia University for the next two years, where she taught half time and
did graduate work in mathematics. She received her master’s degree in 1925 and
spent the next two years in Keyser, West Virginia, as head of the mathematics
department of Potomac State School, a junior college that was established as a
preparatory school for West Virginia University in 1901. It was also known as
Potomac State College, which later became its oﬃcial name; it is now a division of
the university.

In 1927 Harshbarger went to the University of Illinois, where she was an assistant
until 1929 and then a fellow for the year 1929–30. Her dissertation in algebraic
geometry was written under the direction of A. B. Coble; she minored in physics.
After receiving her PhD in 1930, Harshbarger went to Istanbul, Turkey, where
she was a professor in the American College for Girls (also known as Constantinople
Woman’s College) 1930–34. After she left the school, she was replaced by Henrietta
Terry (Nee), who had just received her PhD from Illinois. Upon Harshbarger’s
return to the United States, she taught at the high school associated with the
University of Chicago.

In the fall of 1935, Harshbarger was appointed instructor at Kent State Univer-
sity in Ohio. She was assistant professor 1936–42, associate professor 1942–46, and
professor 1946–72. She was designated emeritus professor upon her retirement in
1972.

After her death at age eighty-four in 1987 in the Cuyahoga Falls General Hospital
in Ohio, Frances Harshbarger was buried in Woodbine, Iowa. Donations in her
memory were directed to the United Methodist Church in Kent.
