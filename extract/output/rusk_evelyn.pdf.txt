RUSK, Evelyn Carroll. September 28, 1898–December 5, 1964.
Wells College (BA 1920, MA 1922), Cornell University (PhD 1932).

Evelyn Teresa Carroll was the daughter of Teresa (Caraher) (1867–1930) and
William J. Carroll (b. 1860), natives of New York. In June 1900 the family was living
in Rome, New York, where she was born. At that time, her parents reported that
they had been married thirteen years; her mother had had two children, although
only Evelyn Carroll, then one year old, was living; and her father was owner of a
knitting mill. In 1910 she had a six-year-old brother, William J. Jr. Although a
birth year of 1900 for Evelyn Carroll appears in later documents, the 1900 census
and corroborating evidence point to the 1898 date above as correct.

Evelyn T. Carroll received her preparation for college at Miss Lamphier’s Private
School and Rome Free Academy and then studied at Wells College, a women’s
college in Aurora, New York. After receiving her bachelor’s degree in 1920, Carroll
became an instructor at Wells; she also continued her studies there and received a
master’s degree in 1922. She was promoted to assistant professor in 1924 and served
as acting head of the department 1924–25. She studied at Columbia University
during the summer of 1924 and while on leave in 1927–28. Also in 1928 she worked
for the General Motors Export Company. She studied at Cornell University 1929–31
and became associate professor at Wells upon her return in 1931, a semester before
receiving her doctorate from Cornell in February 1932. She wrote her dissertation
in geometry under the direction of Virgil Snyder and had minors in analysis and
algebra.

Evelyn Carroll married William Sener Rusk, an art historian at Wells, in Aurora
on August 31, 1932. William S. Rusk was born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1892 and
received a bachelor’s degree from Princeton University in 1915. He later received a
master’s degree in 1924 and a PhD in 1933 from Johns Hopkins University. Rusk
taught in preparatory schools before ﬁrst joining the faculty at Wells College in
1921. He taught for three years, 1925–28, at Dartmouth College, before returning
to Wells as professor of ﬁne arts; he remained at Wells for thirty years until his
retirement in 1968.

Evelyn Carroll Rusk was promoted to professor in 1934. She published several
papers and one review under the name Evelyn Carroll-Rusk in the 1930s and used
that form of her name in a few other professional contexts. She served as acting
dean at Wells 1937–38 and became dean in 1938. While she was dean she was active
in national and state associations for deans and was a member of the Cooperative
Bureau for Teachers, where she was on the board 1938–51 and served as chairman
of the board 1940–42. She remained as dean and professor until 1951, when she
resigned the deanship and took a year’s sabbatical to study mathematics curricula
at colleges and universities in the United States. During this leave she held a fel-
lowship from the Ford Foundation Fund for the Advancement of Education. After
returning from her sabbatical year, Rusk returned to the mathematics department,
and in 1954 she became chairman of the department.

Rusk was Roman Catholic and a Republican. In about 1940 she indicated that
her favorite recreations were golf and bridge and that her hobby was dramatics.
While at Wells she was very active in faculty theatre productions, one of which was
“Hedda Gabler” in 1947–48. She served as chairman of the mathematics department
until her death at age sixty-six of a heart attack in her home in Aurora in 1964. She

was survived by her husband and her brother. William Sener Rusk died in 1984. In
1970 the Evelyn Carroll Rusk ’20 Theatre Series was funded by a student from the
class of 1934.
