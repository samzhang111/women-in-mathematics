GRAUSTEIN, Mary F. (Curtis). April 12, 1884–July 18, 1972.
Wellesley College (BA 1906), Radcliffe College (MA 1915, PhD 1917).

Mary Florence Curtis was born in Westminster, Massachusetts, the eldest of ﬁve
children of Jennie Esther (Lucas) (1857–1945) and Frank Abbott Curtis (1857–
1937), both of Massachusetts. Her parents married in 1883. She grew up on a land-
grant farm of 1790 in Westminster, in north central Massachusetts. Her siblings were
brothers, Wolfred Abbott (1885–1979), Herman Nelson (1888–1963), and Henry
Lucas (1891–1930), and a sister, Esther Jane (1896–1956), who was a member of
the Wellesley class of 1917. Her brother Herman graduated from Harvard in 1911.
Mary Curtis attended Fitchburg High School in Massachusetts 1899–1902 before
entering Wellesley College in 1902. She was a Wellesley honors scholar 1904–05
and 1905–06 and received her bachelor’s degree in 1906. The two years after her
graduation she taught German, algebra, and geometry at Leominster High School, a
short distance from her family’s home in Westminster, while also traveling in Europe
in summer 1907. The following two years, from September 1908 until March 1910,
she taught German and natural science at Cushing Academy in Ashburnham, also
near her family’s home. She had spent the summer semester of 1909 at Cornell
studying botany and pedagogy. For three semesters, from May 1910 until August
1911, she studied mathematics and natural science at the university in Leipzig,
Germany.

Upon her return from Leipzig, she joined the Wellesley College faculty as an
instructor of mathematics. She was instructor from September 1911 to June 1914.
In the meantime, she had begun her graduate studies in mathematics at Radcliﬀe
College in September 1913. At Radcliﬀe she held a Mary E. Horton fellowship from
Wellesley 1914–15 and earned her master’s degree in 1915 and her doctorate in 1917
with a dissertation in diﬀerential geometry. Charles L. Bouton, associate professor,
and Julian L. Coolidge, assistant professor, signed as faculty reviewers, and it is
likely that she worked most closely with Coolidge. Curtis spent the year 1917–18 at
the College for Women, Western Reserve University, in Cleveland, Ohio, as instruc-
tor and acting head, replacing a faculty member who was on leave. She returned
to Wellesley, where she was instructor 1918–20 and assistant professor 1920–21.
She was in Leipzig in the summer of 1920. In a November 1920 letter extracted in
the Bulletin of the AMS, the Italian geometer and historian of mathematics Gino
Loria wrote to the American historian of mathematics D. E. Smith that “Mary F.
Curtis had established [a] remarkable result, that every rectiﬁable skew parabola is
a helix” (27 (1921): 201). The extract from Loria’s letter referred to Curtis’s 1918
paper “On the rectiﬁability of a twisted cubic” and motivated her 1921 paper “On
skew parabolas.”

On June 10, 1921, at age thirty-seven, Mary F. Curtis married William Caspar
Graustein in Wellesley. Graustein, born on November 15, 1888, in Cambridge, Mas-
sachusetts, had earned both his BA in 1910 and his MA in 1911 from Harvard. He
was a traveling fellow from Harvard and earned his PhD in mathematics from Bonn
in 1913. He returned to Harvard in 1913 as instructor of mathematics, and it was
at Harvard that Mary Curtis was one of his students. He was at Rice Institute in
Houston from 1914 to 1918. In 1919, after serving with the Ordnance Department
of the US Army, Graustein again joined the faculty at Harvard.

After her marriage, Mary C. Graustein took a leave of absence for two years
before she returned to Wellesley in 1923 as assistant professor. She remained at
Wellesley until 1929, with a leave of absence in her ﬁnal year, 1928–29. From 1926
until 1941 Graustein and Rachel Blodgett Adams were both tutors at Radcliﬀe,
although Graustein was in Europe with her husband during the years 1928–29 and
1937–38. Graustein’s 1931 report to the Wellesley alumnae magazine gives an in-
dication of her activities. She wrote that they were in Lugano for the winter of
1928–29, where her husband ﬁnished his textbook, Introduction to Higher Geom-
etry. During the summer of 1930 she “helped with the proof reading of the book,
corrected papers for a course in the Summer School, and copied the manuscript for
the second half of a mathematical text (in German).” She also described her work
at Radcliﬀe in the Wellesley Magazine: “My tutorial work at Radcliﬀe consists of
eleven ‘tutees.’ I see each of them for an hour every other week. Three of them are
Seniors; they and their theses on ‘Inﬁnite Series,’ ‘Curve Fitting’ and ‘The Number
System of Algebra’ do their bit to keep me busy. I enjoy the work and the girls”
(Wellesley College Alumnae Oﬃce). Mary Graustein was a member of the AMS
committee on arrangements for its meetings at the Harvard Tercentenary in 1936.
The Grausteins had no children.

The Grausteins spent every other summer in the Dolomites until prevented by
World War II. William C. Graustein was professor of mathematics and assistant
dean at Harvard when he was killed in an automobile accident, at the age of ﬁfty-
two, on January 22, 1941. In 1945 his older brother Archibald established the
William Caspar Graustein Memorial Fund, which endowed a named professorship
at Harvard, and in 1993 Archibald’s son, William C. Graustein, a geochemist, en-
larged the fund by $50 million and extended its focus to include preschool programs
and elementary and secondary schools in Connecticut.

Mary C. Graustein eventually resumed full-time teaching after her husband’s
death. She was at Hunter College as instructor in the summer session 1941 and then
held both substitute and part-time positions at Connecticut College and Abbott
Academy in October and November 1941 and at Hunter College the rest of 1941–42.
She was assistant professor at Oberlin College 1942–44 but had a leave of absence
1943–44 to care for her mother who was ill. She began teaching at Tufts College
(now University) as assistant professor in 1944. In 1949 she wrote for the Wellesley
alumnae magazine that she had come to Tufts to teach the Navy navigation and
calculus and that she stayed on to teach the veterans after the war. She indicated
that she maintained an apartment in Cambridge and kept her family’s farm in
Westminster. She also reported in the Wellesley Magazine, “Last summer in the
midst of much needed painting and repairing at the farm, and at the end of Summer
School, I ﬂew to Germany for a month–my ﬁrst trip by air. I had waited all the
previous summer for a Military permit to go to G¨ottingen to ﬁnish some of my
husband’s papers and had little hope of getting a permit. I could have gone to
Frankfurt in 1947 for a year as Mathematical Consultant at our Army Center; I
would have enjoyed it for the summer but not for the winter” (Wellesley College
Alumnae Oﬃce).

Graustein was promoted to associate professor at Tufts in 1950 and remained
there until her retirement in 1955. From 1946 until 1954, she was also faculty res-
ident of Paige Hall, a dormitory associated with Jackson College, the women’s

coordinate college that is now fully integrated into the university. After her retire-
ment she lived at her family home in Westminster. She continued to travel and to
go to Cambridge for the symphony concert series. She described herself in the early
1940s as a Congregationalist and a Republican.

Mary Curtis Graustein died at eighty-eight in Heywood Memorial Hospital in
Gardner, Massachusetts, and was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge.
She was survived by her brother Wolfred.
