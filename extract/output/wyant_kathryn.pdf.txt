WYANT, Kathryn. January 16, 1897–July 16, 1942.
University of Missouri (BS 1921, MA 1922, PhD 1929).

Emily Kathryn Wyant was born in Ipava, Illinois, the younger of two children of Alice
Mary (Dillon) (b. 1864) and Clarence Jacob Wyant (b. 1871), natives of Illinois. Her older
brother, Kenneth D., was born in 1894. In 1900 the family was living in Dixon, in northern
Illinois, and her father’s occupation was described in the census report as “student.”
Kathryn Wyant attended a country grade school in Bader, Illinois, about twenty-ﬁve
miles from Ipava. In 1910 the family was living in Bolivar, Missouri, where her father was
a merchant. Kathryn graduated from the high school there in May 1914.

Wyant entered the University of Missouri in June 1914 and did most of her under-
graduate work in summer sessions there. She taught two winters in rural schools in Polk
County, Missouri, and three in the high schools at Callao and Neosho, Missouri, before
receiving her BS in education in June 1921.

Wyant was an instructor in mathematics at the University of Missouri from 1921 until
1930. She completed her master’s degree at Missouri with a major in physics and a minor
in mathematics in 1922. After having attended one summer session at the University of
Chicago, she completed the work for her PhD at Missouri with a major in mathematics
and a minor in astronomy. Her 1929 dissertation was directed by G. E. Wahlin. She also
thanked W. D. A. Westfall, Louis Ingold, E. S. Haynes, and E. R. Hedrick for their interest
in her work.

From 1930 to 1933 Wyant was professor of mathematics at Northeastern State Teachers
College (now Northeastern State University) in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. From 1933 to 1934
Wyant did postgraduate work at the University of Chicago before joining, in 1934, the
faculty at Athens College (now Athens State University) in Athens, Alabama. The college,
founded in 1822 as Athens Female Academy, had become coeducational in 1931. She served
as chairman of the department of mathematics there until her early retirement in 1940
because of ill health.

Throughout her career Wyant was unusually active in professional and honorary so-
cieties. While she was at Missouri she was particularly involved with the mathematics
honorary fraternity Pi Mu Epsilon, the graduate women’s scientiﬁc fraternity Sigma Delta
Epsilon, and the MAA. In 1925 she was the corresponding secretary of the University of
Missouri chapter of Pi Mu Epsilon when there were only nine chapters. She was national
vice president of Sigma Delta Epsilon in 1926 and president from June to December 1926.
The following year she was chairman of the Missouri Section of the MAA. Also during
this period Wyant became interested in some Diophantine problems and solutions that
had appeared in The Missouri Intelligencer in 1823 and 1824 and spoke about them to
the local Pi Mu Epsilon chapter and to the Missouri Section of the MAA.

While at Northeastern State Teachers College, Wyant transformed the existing math-
ematics club into the ﬁrst chapter of Kappa Mu Epsilon, a mathematics honor society for
schools that place an emphasis on undergraduate education. This ﬁrst chapter was installed
in 1931 with twenty-four members, and by the end of 1932 there were six chapters. Kappa
Mu Epsilon was granted membership into the Association of College Honor Societies in
1968. The society produces a journal, The Pentagon, and has grown to over a hundred
chapters. In addition to founding Kappa Mu Epsilon, she served as its ﬁrst national pres-
ident 1931–35 and its fourth national historian 1939–41. In 1936 she was a co-founder
of the Tennessee Valley Mathematics Association for high school teachers, junior college
teachers, and others interested in mathematics. She served as secretary-treasurer of the
mathematics division of the Alabama Education Association 1936–37.

Wyant was a Methodist and was a member of the Order of the Eastern Star. In about
1940 she listed her hobbies as supervising mathematics fraternity work and driving her car.

She also indicated that her favorite recreation was “playing with cocker spaniel” (AmWom
1935–40).

In 1940 Wyant was living in Birmingham, Alabama; she was living outside of Athens,
Alabama, at the time of her death at age forty-ﬁve in 1942. The death certiﬁcate indicates
only that she died of natural causes. She is buried in Ipava, Illinois, the town of her birth.
