BACON, Clara L. August 13, 1866–April 14, 1948.
Hedding College (PhB 1886), Wellesley College (BA 1890), University of
Chicago (MA 1904), Johns Hopkins University (PhD 1911).

Clara Latimer Bacon was born in Hillsgrove, Illinois, the daughter of Louisa
(Latimer) (1831–1914) of Abingdon, Illinois, and Larkin Crouch Bacon (1818–1877),
originally from Tennessee. Her father was a farmer and dealt in stock. Her parents
married, each for a second time, in 1864. Clara was the eldest of four children of this
marriage; her siblings were a sister, Nannie (1867–1880); a brother, Willie Larkin
(ca. 1871–1880); and a sister, Agnes Latimer (1874–1930).

Clara Bacon attended primary school at the Hillsgrove county school and sec-
ondary school at the North Abingdon High School. After receiving her PhB in 1886
from Hedding College in Abingdon, Bacon taught for the year 1886–87 at a private
school in Dover, Kansas. She enrolled at Wellesley College in 1887 and received
her second bachelor’s degree in 1890. When she later received her PhD, the Welles-
ley instructor whom she singled out for thanks was Ellen Hayes, who had gone
to Wellesley in 1879 shortly after she received a bachelor’s degree from Oberlin
College.

After graduating from Wellesley, Bacon taught for seven years (1890–97) at four
diﬀerent schools. The ﬁrst year she taught in a private school in Litchﬁeld, Kentucky,
and the next two years she taught mathematics and German and served as librarian
at Hedding College. During 1893–95 she was principal of North Abingdon High
School, and ﬁnally, during 1895–97 she was preceptress and teacher of mathematics
at Grand Prairie Seminary, a secondary school in Onarga in eastern Illinois.

In 1897 Bacon was hired as an instructor at Woman’s College of Baltimore
(Goucher College after 1910), beginning a career there that was to last until 1934.
In 1897 the only other mathematician on the faculty was William H. Maltbie, who
in 1891 had used the president of Hedding College as a reference for admission
to the Johns Hopkins University and who had earned his doctorate from Johns
Hopkins in 1895. At the time that Bacon went to Maryland, her sister Agnes had
just earned a bachelor’s degree in physics at Wellesley, and they both moved to
Baltimore with their mother.

During the summers of 1901 to 1904, Bacon studied at the University of Chicago.
She completed her thesis in 1903, received her master’s degree in September 1904,
and was promoted to associate professor at Woman’s College the following year.
She also studied at Chicago during the summers of 1907 and 1908.

In 1907 the trustees of Johns Hopkins voted to allow women to be admitted to
graduate courses without the special permission that had been needed by Chris-
tine Ladd (Ladd-Franklin) in 1878 and Charlotte Barnum in 1890. The resolution
adopted did permit individual instructors to object to women in their classes, how-
ever. In September 1907, Bacon applied to Johns Hopkins to study mathematics;
in October 1910, she applied for candidacy for the PhD degree in mathematics
with subordinate subjects education and philosophy. One of the courses she used
to fulﬁll the philosophy requirement was a 1908–09 course in symbolic logic with
Christine Ladd-Franklin.

During 1909–11 Bacon was a fellow by courtesy at Johns Hopkins, and during
the second of these two years she held a fellowship from the Baltimore Association
for the Promotion of the University Education of Women, an organization that

Ladd-Franklin had helped to organize in 1897. During this period Bacon’s sister
Agnes was a physics student at Johns Hopkins, and in 1914 she was a mathematics
student at the University of Chicago. Agnes Bacon worked at the Johns Hopkins
School of Hygiene and Public Health and published several articles in the ﬁeld of
biometrics during the early 1920s.

Clara Bacon received her PhD from Johns Hopkins in 1911, the ﬁrst year Johns
Hopkins granted PhD’s to women without special approval of the trustees. She
was one of four women to receive a PhD from Johns Hopkins that year, the only
one of the four in mathematics. She was, however, the second woman to earn a
PhD in mathematics from Johns Hopkins; Ladd-Franklin, the ﬁrst in 1882, was not
awarded the degree until 1926.

Bacon was one of the ﬁrst two women to study mathematics at Johns Hopkins
under its new policy. The other was Florence P. Lewis, who was enrolled full time
during 1907–08, joined the mathematics faculty at the Woman’s College of Balti-
more in 1908, completed her work for the PhD at Johns Hopkins in 1913, and also
spent the rest of her career at Goucher College.

In 1913 Bacon published her dissertation in the American Journal of Mathemat-
ics and the following year was promoted to professor. She remained in that rank
until she retired in 1934 as professor emeritus. Her only other teaching position was
during the summer of 1922 at Hunter College. During her years at Goucher, stu-
dents, faculty colleagues, and administrators all valued her teaching, organization,
and general humanity. After her death a colleague wrote: “Few people have given
a more constant and loyal devotion to Goucher College. To the amazement of her
colleagues, Miss Bacon never lost her keen zest in the whole round of college ac-
tivities, from Matriculation Vespers all the way to Commencement Exercises. The
secret of this unﬂagging delight lay, I believe, in her real interest in every one of
her students, and in her warm friendly feelings toward her colleagues” (Lewis 1948,
20).

While Bacon was on the Goucher mathematics faculty, ten women graduated who
later received PhD’s in mathematics. Of these ten, seven received their doctorates
from the Johns Hopkins University. At the time of Bacon’s retirement, Marguerite
Lehr, who had graduated from Goucher in 1919, wrote that “for those students
who majored in mathematics [Bacon’s] relation with the Johns Hopkins University
was of great importance. Advanced work sometimes took particular form because
of a senior’s plan to continue her work there” (1934, 3). Bacon not only encouraged
women to go to graduate school but assisted many ﬁnancially so that they could do
so. After her death, an administrator wrote that “in committees Dr. Bacon fought
for the individual who was not brilliant but who was potentially a good and useful
citizen, and her judgment was usually sound. It was understood that a student
who was good, but not quite good enough to receive a scholarship, might receive
ﬁnancial help from her. We felt it wise to be on guard against letting her hear
of too many such cases” (Lewis 1948, 20). Bacon was also generous to Goucher;
two years before her retirement she provided the institution with funds so that the
department could purchase a Monroe calculating machine.

Bacon was active in many organizations. She was a charter member of the MAA
and stood for election to the board of trustees in 1922 and for vice president in 1924
and 1929. Although she was never elected to a national oﬃce in the MAA, she was
a member of the executive committee (1919) and then chairman (1931–32) of the

Maryland-District of Columbia-Virginia Section. She was president of the Baltimore
chapter of the AAUP and of the College Club (the Baltimore branch of AAUW), and
served for many years on the College Entrance Examination Board. She was also a
member of the Equal Suﬀrage League of Baltimore, the Foreign Policy Association,
the League of Women Voters, and the Daughters of the American Revolution. In
1937 she reported that she was a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church and
“several associations for peace” (Owens questionnaire). Bacon was an avid traveler,
who had traveled with her sister, Agnes, before Agnes’s death in 1930. After Bacon’s
retirement she fulﬁlled a promise to Agnes to travel again, and she visited England,
Italy, Egypt, and Palestine during a ﬁfteen-month trip abroad.

After an illness of a year, Clara Bacon died in the Baltimore home she had
shared with her mother and sister until their deaths. She had been an active church
member, and her funeral service was held in the First Methodist Church, which
was near the house on Calvert Street in which she had lived for ﬁfty years. She is
buried in Cherry Grove Cemetery near Abingdon, Illinois. The Clara and Agnes
scholarship is an endowed scholarship at Goucher, and one of the residential houses
at Goucher is named in honor of Clara Bacon.
