Emily Matilda Coddington was born in New York City, the only child of Julia (Fel-
lows) (1840–1926) and Jeﬀerson Coddington (1832–1876), both of New York City and
both descended from early seventeenth-century colonial settlers. Her parents married in
December 1872. Her father, who had been married previously, was a graduate of Columbia
College and an attorney in the city. In 1880 the six-year-old Emily and her mother were
living with her maternal grandmother at 24 West 58th Street in Manhattan, her father
having died four years earlier. The household also included six other family members and
six servants. This was the primary residence for Emily Coddington until her marriage.

Coddington studied at private schools in the New York City area, beginning with
Mrs. Wallin’s Kindergarten and including Miss Mason’s School in Tarrytown and Miss
Peebles’ School and the Brearley School in New York City until 1892. In 1891, while at
the Brearley School, she was one of four women to earn a certiﬁcate for having passed
satisfactorily the examinations for women “in accordance with the terms prescribed for
admission to the Freshman Class of Harvard College” (Harvard University Catalogue 1891–
92, 399). This certiﬁcate entitled Coddington to admission to the “Harvard Annex,” a
Cambridge institution for women run by the Society for Collegiate Instruction of Women.
The “Harvard Annex” oﬀered classes taught by Harvard faculty and was the precursor to
Radcliﬀe College. While there is no indication that she attended the “Harvard Annex,”
Coddington matriculated at the University of London in June 1894 and received her
Intermediate Arts in 1895 and her BA in 1896. Also in 1896 she wrote what would be her
master’s thesis for a degree in mathematics, with minors in mechanics and Greek, that was
awarded two years later by Columbia University. She wrote both this thesis and her PhD
dissertation on historical topics. In her dissertation she referred to several papers by the
Swedish geometer A. V. B¨acklund. Some time before she received her doctorate in 1905 she
published an English translation of an 1883 paper of his. Although Coddington never took
any paid positions in mathematics, she did maintain some contact with the mathematical
community. She kept her membership in the AMS until her death. She attended the
International Congress of Mathematicians in Rome in 1908 and in Cambridge, England,
in 1912, and she often attended meetings of the AMS in New York City until shortly
before her marriage in 1917.

In 1903 Emily Coddington became a member of the Women’s Advisory Committee of
New York University’s Council of the University. She attended the Law School of NYU
starting in 1909 and was admitted to the New York Bar in January 1912 before receiving
her law degree from New York University in 1913. In her 1911 application to the Committee
on Character of the Bar Association she indicated that she had neither been employed in,
nor studied law in, a law oﬃce, nor had she ever been engaged in any business or profession
other than the law. A decade later she indicated that she had never practiced law. The
New York Times listed Coddington among the “many prominent New York women” to be
seated in boxes at an anti-suﬀrage meeting to be held at Carnegie Hall in 1915. She also
continued her service on the NYU Women’s Advisory Committee and served as treasurer
at least during 1907–08 and as secretary at least during 1915–17.

On November 5, 1917, at the age of forty-four, Coddington married William Henry
Williams (1876–1943), an executive with an exporting business at the time of their mar-
riage. William Henry Williams had been educated at Pratt Institute and Packard Business
College and was chairman of the board of North Central Texas Oil Company at the time
of his death. Both before and after her marriage Emily Coddington Williams lived in
New York City, although she and her husband also had a summer home, Villa Rosa, in
Newport, Rhode Island. They had no children.

Emily Coddington Williams had wide-ranging interests. They included gardening, ge-
nealogy, and the writing of ﬁction among many others. In particular, she was an active
member of the Garden Club of America, was at one time on the board of directors of
the International Garden Club in Pelham Bay Park, and belonged to the Tuxedo, Piping
Rock, Colony, and Cosmopolitan clubs. In 1914 she secured a copyright for a typed one-act
play called “Then.” After her marriage she published another one-act play, two novels,
and a sketch of William Coddington, a colonial governor of Rhode Island.

During the course of her life Emily C. Williams made many trips to Europe, frequently
with her mother and later with her husband. In addition to the trips to England between
1894 and 1896 while she was a student in London and in 1908 and 1912 for the mathe-
matical congresses in England and in Italy, it appears that she made several other voyages
between 1905 and 1914 and nearly every year with her husband in the 1920s and 1930s.
After the death of her husband in 1943, Williams moved from their townhouse on East
63rd Street in New York City to the Hotel Pierre, also in Manhattan.

In 1952 Williams made her last trip to Europe, on the Queen Mary. After having frac-
tured her hip on board ship in April, Emily Williams died at the American Hospital in
Paris in August 1952 at age seventy-eight. Her estate, which included a large amount of
real estate and was estimated at $12,000,000, was divided among her two godchildren and
charitable groups in New York City and Newport, Rhode Island. The New York organiza-
tions included the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, the Colonial Dames
of America, the Marble Collegiate Church, and Peabody Home for Aged and Indigent
Women. The Rhode Island organizations included Trinity Church, the Redwood Library,
the Reading Room, and the Newport Historical Society.
