WORTHINGTON, Euphemia Richardson. December 22, 1881–August 30, 1969.
Wellesley College (BA 1904), Yale University (PhD 1908).

Euphemia Richardson Worthington was born in Troy, New York, the ﬁrst of three
daughters of Sophia Adelaide (Whidden) (1851–1895) and John Worthington (1840–1913).
Her mother was born in Nova Scotia and was boarding in Troy with Harriet Richardson and
Richardson’s brother in June 1880 before her marriage to the widowed John Worthington
in December that year. Her father was born in New York State, had three children by his
previous marriage, and was a coal dealer. Her sisters were Jennie Adelaide (1883–1888)
and Dorothy (b. 1887). Harriet Richardson was living with the Worthington family in
1900.

Euphemia Worthington attended the Emma Willard School in Troy 1895–1900. She
then entered Wellesley College, where she was known as Eﬃe. Her mathematics courses at
Wellesley included elementary and college algebra; theory of equations and determinants;
plane, solid, plane analytic, solid analytic, modern synthetic, and projective geometry;
calculus; and astronomy. She graduated in 1904.

Worthington entered Yale University in 1905 and wrote her dissertation under the
direction of James Pierpont. After receiving her PhD in 1908, Worthington taught for a
year at the Emma Willard School. From 1909 to 1918 she was an instructor at Wellesley,
her undergraduate alma mater. She was one of seven Wellesley faculty who were listed as
charter members of the MAA in 1916. In 1918 she left Wellesley to do war work during
World War I. She was assistant to the chief engineer of the Gallaudet Aircraft Corporation
in East Greenwich, Rhode Island, from July 1918 to May 1919. She reported for the 1919
issue of the Wellesley Class of 1904 Record Book: “This summer I have been working for an
aircraft company near Providence and am ﬁnding my work, which is doing mathematical
work for the chief engineer, very interesting and very far from monotonous, a decided
change from teaching freshmen” (Wellesley College Archives). In May 1919 Worthington
also took, and passed, the ﬁrst part of the associate examination of the Actuarial Society
of America (ASA). Later in 1919 she was unemployed and living in Pasadena, California.
She resumed her position at the Gallaudet Aircraft Corporation and worked there again
from March 1920 to January 1922. In May 1920 she passed the second part of the ASA
associate examination and apparently never attempted the remaining two parts.

In January 1922 Worthington was appointed instructor in mathematics at the Southern
Branch of the University of California. This former state normal school conferred its ﬁrst
bachelor’s degree in 1923 and changed its name to the University of California at Los
Angeles in 1927. From about that time until her retirement at age sixty-seven, Worthington
regularly attended meetings of the Southern California Section of the MAA and regional
meetings of the AMS held in southern California. Worthington became assistant professor
in 1925 and retired as assistant professor emeritus in 1949. She had leaves with two-thirds
salary from March 25 to June 30 in 1929 and from January 1 to June 30 in 1932. She
worked as a stress analyst in the engineering department of the Bell Aircraft Company in
Buﬀalo, New York, in summer 1942. She was also designated an emeritus fellow by UCLA
in 1954.

For some years after her retirement, Worthington spent summers in Carmel, California,
and winters in Victoria, British Columbia, before eventually moving permanently to Vic-
toria. Euphemia Worthington died following surgery for a fall in 1969 at age eighty-seven
in Victoria. She had no surviving relatives.
