LEWIS, Florence P. September 24, 1877–March 10, 1964.
University of Texas (BA 1897, MA 1898), Radcliffe College (MA 1906), Johns
Hopkins University (PhD 1913).

Florence Parthenia Lewis was born in Fort Scott, Kansas, the daughter of Mon-
imia (Chase) (ca. 1851–1923) and Walter Felix Lewis (1846–1903), who married in
1872. Her parents were both born in Missouri, and her paternal grandfather was a
judge of the Supreme Court of Missouri. By the time of the 1900 census her mother
had had seven children, six of whom were living. The children were Walter Howard
(b. 1873), George Chase (b. 1876), Florence Parthenia, Francis Ann (b. 1884), Su-
san Elizabeth (1885–1967), Walter Felix (b. 1889), and Eugene Grayson (b. 1896).
The six youngest were still living in 1900.

Lewis attended high school in Austin, Texas, and entered the University of Texas
as a sophomore with advanced standing in 1894. When she entered she was in the
group leading to a bachelor of literature; her last two years she was in the program
leading to the bachelor of arts degree. Her ﬁrst two years at the University of Texas
she held the high school scholarship from Austin High School, which was given
annually to the graduate of each aﬃliated high school with the highest standing in
the class, and which carried with it exemption from all matriculation or tuition fees.
Lewis graduated from the university in 1897; her obituary states that her degree
was in classics. She later noted in her dissertation vita that when she received her
degree “Dr. G. B. Halsted was professor of mathematics.” In a 1922 obituary of
Halsted by H. Y. Benedict, excerpted in the Monthly, Lewis is referred to as one of
Halsted’s “great pupils” (29:352).

Lewis remained at Texas 1897–98 as a graduate student with major subjects
mathematics, philosophy, and pedagogy. Her master’s degree in 1898 was awarded
in philosophy. In a letter to E. F. Buchner of January 21, 1911, S. E. Mezes, then
president of the University of Texas, described her work as his student during the
year 1897–98 and noted that she did work in Greek and mathematics that year as
well as in philosophy. Of her work in the philosophy courses he wrote that “one
dealt with the history of Philosophy, and the other was a seminary course of an
advanced character and, as nearly as I can remember, dealt with some fundamental
logical problems. As to the quality of Miss Lewis’ work, I can speak with certainty.
No student I have taught had a better mind or more interest in Philosophy. I am
not given to extravagance of statement, but if I were I would employ it with regard
to her” (student ﬁles, The Ferdinand Hamburger Archives of the Johns Hopkins
University).

After receiving her master’s degree, Lewis spent the next year, 1898–99, as a
fellow in philosophy at Bryn Mawr College. In 1899–1900 she was a traveling fellow
from Bryn Mawr; she studied a half year at the Sorbonne and, during the summer
quarter, at Z¨urich. Her work that year included lectures and reading on the philos-
ophy of Spinoza by L´evy-Bruhl, study of Aristotle (in Greek), a Kant seminar, and
some lectures on experimental psychology.

After Lewis’s return from Europe, it appears that she taught for a year in Mis-
sissippi. She then returned to the University of Texas where she remained for the
next four years. She was listed in the university catalogues as a graduate student
in mathematics 1901–02, a graduate student and a tutor in mathematics 1902–
03, and a tutor in mathematics 1903–05. For 1905–06, she was listed as a tutor

in mathematics, absent on leave. During that year she earned her master’s degree
in mathematics at Radcliﬀe College after which she returned to Texas for a ﬁnal
year as tutor in pure mathematics. As tutor in mathematics, Lewis taught regular
mathematics courses. For example, her last year at Texas she taught an introductory
mathematics course that included solid geometry, plane trigonometry, and algebra
with an introduction to analytic geometry; she also taught algebra, which included
theory of equations, determinants, symmetric functions, and theory of polynomials.
In 1907 the trustees of Johns Hopkins University voted to open graduate courses
to women. In September of that year Clara Latimer Bacon and Florence Parthe-
nia Lewis both applied for admission to the graduate program in mathematics at
the Johns Hopkins University. Bacon, on the faculty at Woman’s College of Balti-
more (Goucher College after 1910) since 1897, became in 1911 the ﬁrst woman to
be granted a PhD in mathematics from Johns Hopkins. Lewis began her graduate
studies at Johns Hopkins with mathematics as her major and the history of philos-
ophy and psychology as subordinate subjects. She studied full time during 1907–08
and joined Bacon on the faculty at Woman’s College as instructor in the fall of
1908. Lewis took two courses at Johns Hopkins in 1908–09, remained at Woman’s
College, and was again a full-time student at Johns Hopkins during 1911–12. In Jan-
uary 1911 Lewis made application for her PhD. A few days later the committee on
instruction in the department of philosophy, psychology, and education accepted
the records of advanced work previously done by her at Texas, Byrn Mawr, the
Sorbonne, and Z¨urich. She received her PhD, the second granted to a woman in
mathematics by Johns Hopkins, in 1913 with a dissertation in algebraic geometry
written under the direction of Frank Morley.

When Lewis joined the mathematics faculty at Woman’s College of Baltimore in
1908, the other faculty members were Bacon and William H. Maltbie. Maltbie, who
had earned a law degree, left the following year to practice law. Except for brief
appointments of instructors, Bacon and Lewis were the mathematics faculty until
they were joined in 1925 by Marion M. Torrey, at that time a recent Cornell PhD.
While Bacon and Lewis were on the Goucher mathematics faculty, nine women
graduated who later received PhD’s in mathematics, six from Johns Hopkins.

Except for two leaves of absence, Lewis spent her entire career at Goucher. She
was promoted from instructor to assistant professor in 1912, to associate professor
in 1914, to professor in 1922, and to professor emeritus upon her retirement in
1947. Lewis spent her second leave of absence in 1918–19 at Wellesley College in
an exchange with Clara E. Smith. She was well respected in the mathematical
community and served on the council of the AMS 1921–23, the ﬁrst woman since
Charlotte A. Scott last served at the turn of the century. She also was a member
of the honorary committee that arranged a meeting in honor of Scott in 1922.
Lewis served as chairman of the Goucher mathematics department from 1931 to
1943. In addition to teaching mathematics, she was responsible for the founding of
Goucher’s astronomy program within the mathematics department and maintained
memberships in the American Astronomical Society and the Astronomical Society
of the Paciﬁc. In 1954, seven years after she retired, the six-inch refracting Florence
P. Lewis telescope was installed at Goucher.

Lewis and Bacon were both charter members of the MAA, and for various periods
from the early 1920s through the early 1940s, Lewis served on the executive com-
mittee of the Maryland-District of Columbia-Virginia Section of the MAA. During

the late 1910s and the early 1920s she regularly submitted problems, mostly in ge-
ometry, that were published in the Monthly. In 1932 she attended the International
Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich. She also served on the executive committee
and the council of the AAUP.

Lewis remained in Baltimore, except for trips abroad, after her retirement. She
was able to live in her apartment until illness required that she be in a nursing home
for several weeks before her death in Baltimore at eighty-six in 1964. In a memorial
article in the Goucher Alumnae Quarterly in Spring 1964, Helen Dodson Prince,
a former student and a distinguished astronomer at the University of Michigan,
recalled the “experience in which we met a new-found joy in things of the mind
and spirit . . .
[that] abounded in Dr. Lewis’s classrooms. The source or cause of
this special air I do not know, but I suspect it stemmed in large measure from
Dr. Lewis’s wide-ranging interests and curiosity. For her, all academic disciplines
were fair game for personal inquiry and investigation.” Prince also wrote, “Again
and again I have found myself coming back to something that can perhaps best
be described as ‘sheer delight’–a delight that seemed to permeate her relationship
with subject matter as well as with students.”
