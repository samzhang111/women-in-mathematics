LEHR, Marguerite. October 22, 1898–December 14, 1987.
Goucher College (BA 1919), Bryn Mawr College (PhD 1925).

Anna Marguerite Marie Lehr was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the eldest of ﬁve
children of Margaret (Kreuder) (b. 1871) and George Lehr (b. 1870). Her mother
was born in Maryland, and her father was born in Germany. Her father immi-
grated to the United States in 1890 and was naturalized in 1912; he was a grocer.
Her siblings were Elizabeth (1900–1985), Charlotte (ca. 1905–1967), Charles G. K.
(1908–1993), and George K. (1911–1996). In the 1930 census their occupations were
listed as instructor in a school, librarian, draftsman, and bookkeeper, respectively.
Marguerite Lehr received her primary and secondary education in the public
schools in Baltimore and graduated from Western High School. She entered Goucher
College in 1915 and graduated in 1919. Lehr wrote in 1934 that she had planned to
continue her studies at Johns Hopkins University “until [an] instance of Dr. [Clara
Latimer] Bacon’s unceasing interest in the careers of all her students changed that
plan more radically than she (I think!) or I foresaw” (“Clara Latimer Bacon,” 3).
Bacon suggested she apply for a position at Bryn Mawr College as an assistant to
Charlotte Scott. She spent her ﬁrst two years at Bryn Mawr, 1919–21, as a reader
and graduate student, half time in each position. Patricia Kenschaft indicated in
her 1981 article with interview excerpts that Lehr had graded papers and held oﬃce
hours for Scott, the latter because Scott was deaf. Although Lehr was awarded the
M. Carey Thomas European fellowship for 1921–22, she postponed using it and
remained at Bryn Mawr as a resident fellow in mathematics that year and as a
scholar in mathematics 1922–23. She spent the year 1923–24 in Rome as an AAUW
European fellow and as an M. Carey Thomas European fellow. While in Rome she
worked on her dissertation and studied with Guido Castelnuovo, Federigo Enriques,
and Vito Volterra. Soon after she returned from Italy in July 1924, she began her
long career on the faculty of Bryn Mawr as an instructor. She received her PhD in
1925 with a physics minor and was the last student of Charlotte A. Scott.

In 1929 Lehr was promoted from instructor to associate. She was promoted
to assistant professor in 1935, associate professor in 1937, professor in 1955, and
retired as professor emeritus in 1967. In response to a question about obstacles in
her career, Lehr wrote on her 1970 Bryn Mawr alumni survey that “Only at B.M.,
with its full graduate school, would a woman of my generation, in mathematics,
have had graduate level courses to give, from the ﬁrst – regardless of rank. My
engagement was with mathematics, not ‘teaching,’ consequently I refused any & all
feelers in administration or editing in spite of slow promotion! But the choice was
mine – I wanted the full range of thought, live, not text-book concerns.”

Lehr was an honorary fellow at the Johns Hopkins University 1931–32, her ﬁrst
sabbatical year, and published two more articles in algebraic geometry, one of which
was coauthored by Virgil Snyder of Cornell University. During World War II she
taught mathematics needed to produce maps using photographs in an engineer-
ing science and management war training program at Bryn Mawr; she also taught
mathematics in a V-12 program at Swarthmore College. During the late 1940s and
into the 1950s, Lehr often attended meetings of the Institute of Mathematical Sta-
tistics. In 1950, during her second sabbatical, she visited the Institut Poincar´e in
Paris. During the ﬁrst semester of 1952–53, she presented a ﬁfteen-week course,
“Invitation to Mathematics,” on the television show “University of the Air” in

Philadelphia. This led to several articles, including one in the Monthly; to talks on
presenting mathematics on television; and to her membership on the MAA commit-
tee on ﬁlms for classroom instruction. In 1954 she was a curriculum consultant for
the state of Pennsylvania. In 1956–57 she was a visiting fellow at Princeton Univer-
sity. In 1958–59 she was chair of the Philadelphia Section of the MAA and was an
MAA visiting lecturer; as such she presented talks at various colleges in Iowa, Mas-
sachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, and Ohio. From 1957
until 1966 she served on a regional award committee of the Woodrow Wilson Fel-
lowship Foundation. She was a member of the School Mathematics Study Group at
Yale University, was an MAA representative to the NSF, and was a member of the
examining committee on the new type of mathematics for the College Entrance Ex-
amination Board. She also gave talks to many Bryn Mawr alumnae groups. In 1954
Lehr received a Goucher alumnae achievement citation, and upon her retirement
from Bryn Mawr in 1967 she received the Lindback Foundation teaching award.

In addition to her year in Rome in 1923–24, Lehr made at least four more trips
to Europe; ship records indicate that she returned from Europe in September in
1928 and 1932 and in August in 1938 and 1950. For a 1961 Bryn Mawr Alumnae
Association survey, Lehr listed some of her “general interests and activities” as
poetry, including “attempts at translation from Fr[ench], Germ[an], Ital[ian],” “up-
holstering and other house projects (some of which do oddly have a math side, too),
not a bad carpenter,” and gardening in Maine, where she spent many summers. In
1968, the year after she retired, Lehr was living in Salisbury, Maryland, where her
sister Charlotte had been living until her death after a lengthy illness in August
1967. In May 1971 Lehr reported to Bryn Mawr from Baltimore that “I am gone
from Salisbury a great deal.” Part of that time is likely to have been in Manset on
Mount Desert Island in Maine, which she described for her 1954 article in the Bryn
Mawr Alumnae Bulletin, as “next to Mathematics, her greatest obsession” (p. 9,
caption).

In November 1972, Marguerite Lehr moved from Salisbury back to Bryn Mawr,
Pennsylvania. She died there in 1987 at the age of eighty-nine. A memorial service
was held in the Episcopal Church of the Redeemer in Bryn Mawr, where she had
been active, and burial was in Baltimore. In 1988 the Marguerite Lehr Scholarship
Fund was established at Bryn Mawr. The fund was made possible through gifts
from her former students and friends and is for undergraduates with need who have
done excellent work in mathematics.
