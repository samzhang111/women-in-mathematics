McFARLAND, Dora. April 18, 1895–November 26, 1987.
Monmouth College (BA 1916), University of Oklahoma (MA 1921), University
of Chicago (PhD 1936).

Dora McFarland was born near Aledo, Illinois, the ﬁrst of two children of Nell
(Blayney) (1868–1912) and Edmund Curry McFarland (1866–1938), natives of Illi-
nois who married in 1893. In 1900 this farm household also included a son, James
Russell (b. 1897); Edmund McFarland’s father; and a boarder.

Dora McFarland attended grade school and high school in Aledo, a small town in
the northern part of the state near the Mississippi River. She then attended nearby
Monmouth College. After her graduation from college in 1916, she taught in high
schools for a number of years: in Gravity, Iowa, 1916–17; Aledo, Illinois, 1917–19;
and Sterling, Illinois, 1919–20.

In the summers of 1919 and 1920 McFarland took classes at the University of
Oklahoma before completing her work for her master’s degree in 1921. She joined
the faculty there as instructor in 1921. Except for the years she was in residence at
Chicago for her doctoral work and for leaves, McFarland remained at Oklahoma the
rest of her career. She was instructor 1921–27, assistant professor 1927–39, associate
professor 1939–48, professor 1948–65, and emeritus professor after her retirement
in 1965 at the age of seventy.

McFarland attended the University of Chicago for four quarters beginning in fall
1924 while on leave from Oklahoma. While on a sabbatical in 1928–29, she returned
to Chicago on a fellowship for four more quarters. She also took courses in spring
and summer 1936 and ﬁnished her dissertation in division algebras as a student of
L. E. Dickson. She joined the AMS shortly after receiving her doctorate in 1936
and remained a member the rest of her life.

In addition to teaching, which was her main contribution at Oklahoma, McFar-
land did committee and administrative work and sponsored student organizations.
During the 1930s and early 1940s she often served as an oﬃcer or sponsor of the
Oklahoma chapter of Pi Mu Epsilon, and in 1945–46 she served as chair of the
Oklahoma Section of the MAA. In the mid-1950s she contributed to a series of
tape recordings made by members of the faculty and sold under the name “Tapes
for Teaching.” McFarland’s contribution was “What should a high school student
expect from mathematics?” She also ran several summer institutes for school math-
ematics and science teachers. Much of her teaching at the University of Oklahoma
was in mathematics education. In the early 1960s, she and Eunice M. Lewis, a col-
league in the education department, produced notes for an introductory course on
arithmetic for elementary teachers; in 1966 they published a more comprehensive
textbook for the same audience. In a review in Choice magazine, the book was
compared favorably with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics’ 29th
Yearbook, Topics in Mathematics for Elementary School Teachers, and was “highly
recommended” (4 (1967): 712).

McFarland was active in a number of organizations not related to mathematics.
She was an elder in the Presbyterian church; was a member of the national board of
the YWCA; and was the Oklahoma founder, president, and international ﬁrst vice
president of Delta Kappa Gamma, an honorary society for women in education. She
was also a member of Kappa Alpha Theta social sorority and in the early 1960s
described herself as a Democrat.

McFarland was a recipient in 1949 of the Matrix Table award given by Theta
Sigma Phi (now Women in Communications, Inc.). In 1953 she was presented
with the $500 University of Oklahoma Foundation teaching award that “was made
for ‘extraordinary excellence in student counseling and teaching of freshman and
sophomores’ ” (Amer. Math. Monthly 61:66). In 1960 she received the Delta Kappa
Gamma International achievement award. Gamma State, the Oklahoma state or-
ganization of the Delta Gamma Kappa Society International, now oﬀers a Dora
McFarland scholarship for one year of graduate study to a member of the society
who is a resident of Oklahoma.

McFarland took her last leave in the fall of 1959 to take a trip to India and
Southeast Asia. Dora McFarland was living in Norman, Oklahoma, at the time of
her death at age ninety-two in 1987. She was survived by a niece, two nephews, and
several great-nieces and great-nephews.
