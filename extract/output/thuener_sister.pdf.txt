THUENER, Sister M. Domitilla. October 25, 1880–September 29, 1977.

ters College) (MA 1923), Catholic University of America (PhD 1932).

Eleanor Margaret Thuener was born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Josephine

(b. 1861) and August Thuener (b. 1856). Her mother was born in Pennsylvania and her
father in Germany. He immigrated to the United States in about 1870, and her parents
married in about 1879. In the 1900 census her father is described as a driver; in 1910 as
a brewery driver. It appears that three children survived of seven who were born. They
were Eleanor, Viola [or Violet R.] (b. 1893), and John Lester (1897–1980). Her mother
was widowed by 1920.

Eleanor Thuener received her elementary education in public and parochial schools in
Allegheny. In the 1900 census she was described as a sewing girl. She graduated from St.
Mary’s Academy, a Catholic boarding school in Monroe, Michigan, in June 1905, when
she was nearly twenty-ﬁve, shortly before entering the convent of the Benedictine Sisters
in Covington, Kentucky, that summer. She took the religious name Mary Domitilla. From
1905 until 1920 Sister M. Domitilla taught in St. Walburg Academy in Covington and
in Villa Madonna Academy, a boarding school for girls run by the Benedictine Sisters in
nearby Crescent Springs, Kentucky, across the Ohio River from Cincinnati.

Sister Domitilla obtained her bachelor’s degree in 1920 from St. Xavier College (Xavier
University since 1930), a Jesuit college for men in Cincinnati, Ohio, by attending special
extension classes, scheduled for late afternoons, Saturdays, and summers, arranged for
the sisters from neighboring congregations. Sister Mary Henrietta Reilly also attended St.
Xavier under similar circumstances. In 1922–23 Sister Domitilla studied at the Catholic
Sisters College associated with the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.,
and received her master’s degree in 1923.

Villa Madonna College in Covington was founded by the Benedictine Sisters in 1921 for
the education of the sisters of the community and for lay women in northern Kentucky. Sr.
Domitilla was the ﬁrst dean, the senior oﬃcer who directed the academic work of the new
college, and was the mathematics instructor from 1921 until 1929, when it graduated its
ﬁrst class of ﬁve students. In 1929 the college came under diocesan control and was jointly
administered by three diﬀerent religious orders. It was also in 1929 that Sister Domitilla
returned to Catholic University, where she completed the work for her PhD in 1932 with
a dissertation in algebraic geometry and with minors in physics and education. Upon her
return to Villa Madonna College she was professor and department head until 1943; she
also taught physics 1934–37. The college became coeducational in 1945. In the late 1960s
it relocated to Crestview Hills, Kentucky, and was renamed Thomas More College.

In 1943 Sister M. Domitilla was elected by her community to be the Prioress of St.
Walburg Convent. She served two successive terms as administrator and religious leader.
In this period she was a member of the board of trustees of Villa Madonna College. Under
her direction the community entered hospital work by taking over the administration
of a hospital in Kentucky and by staﬃng a hospital in Colorado. Sister Domitilla was
considered to be the “prime mover” in furthering the education of Sister Elizabeth Frisch,
O.S.B., who obtained a PhD in 1940 from Catholic University and who followed her as
head of the mathematics department at Villa Madonna College.

Sister Domitilla Thuener died at Villa Madonna in Covington, Kentucky, at age ninety-

six in 1977.
