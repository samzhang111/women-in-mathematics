BURKE, Sister Leonarda. November 24, 1900–March 1, 1998.
Emmanuel College (BA 1926), Boston College (MA 1928), Catholic University
of America (PhD 1931).

Ethel Louise Burke was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the daughter of Caroline
Dorcas (Leonard) (1860–1934) and James Henry Burke (1857–ca. 1904). Her parents
were born in Boston and were educated in the Boston public school system. They
were married in about 1883 and probably had ﬁve children survive to adulthood
of eight born. Of these Ethel was the youngest. Her siblings were sisters, Annie (b.
1890) and Carrie (b. 1893), and brothers, William (b. 1895) and Thomas (b. 1897).
Her mother was a housewife, and her father was chief telegrapher for Western Union
in Boston before his death in his late forties.

Ethel Burke’s primary and secondary education was obtained in Boston public
schools. After her high school graduation in 1918, she attended the Boston Normal
School for three years, 1918–21, to obtain her certiﬁcation to teach in the Boston
school system. Each summer for six years after her high school graduation she
worked as playground instructor for the Boston public schools; the two years after
she received her certiﬁcation she taught in public elementary school in Boston.

In 1923 Burke entered the Congregation of Sisters of Saint Joseph in Boston.
A year later Sister Mary Leonarda Burke began a seven-year period of studying
for her undergraduate and graduate degrees. Her two years, 1924–26, at Emmanuel
College, founded in 1919 as New England’s ﬁrst Catholic college for women, resulted
in her bachelor’s degree as a mathematics major in 1926. Sister Leonarda earned
her master’s degree from Boston College by studying part time while also teaching
mathematics, French, and history at the secondary level in the Boston diocesan
schools. In the ﬁrst year of her master’s work she took courses on weekends; during
the second year she took courses after classes ﬁnished at her school. Her 1928 thesis
had as its topic calculus in high school mathematics.

From 1928 to 1931, Sister Leonarda was in residence at the Catholic University
of America, where she studied mathematics, education, and physics. She was among
a group of ﬁve students, four women religious (Burke, Sr. Mary de Lellis Gough, Sr.
Charles Mary Morrison, and Sr. Mary Felice Vaudreuil) and one lay man (James
Norman Eastham), who earned their PhD’s in 1931 under the direction of Aubrey
E. Landry. All ﬁve wrote dissertations describing and counting the diﬀerent types of
polygons in-and-circumscribed to a rational quartic curve with variously speciﬁed
singularities and symmetries.

In the fall of 1931 she began her long association with Regis College, a Catholic
college for women in Weston, near Boston, founded by her order and opened just
four years earlier. In 1981 Sister Leonarda recalled, “The foresight and aspirations
of the foundress of Regis College, Mother Mary Domitilla, C.S.J., motivated and
enhanced my involvement in mathematics when she was aspiring to have a strong
faculty in the early years, and her eﬀorts provided the departments Latin, History,
Greek, French, Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, etc. in that order” (Smithsonian
questionnaire).

Sister Leonarda served at Regis College in a variety of capacities: as teacher,
administrator, and as researcher. From 1931 to 1964, as professor of mathematics
and chairman of the department, she taught a full complex of courses including
work in analysis (calculus, advanced calculus, and numerical analysis); statistics

(descriptive and mathematical); modern algebra and projective geometry (oﬀered
as electives during the late 1940s and early 1950s); junior and senior seminars;
and computer programming. She engaged in post-doctoral research at Catholic
University in the summer of 1940. She also studied modern mathematical techniques
in teaching at the University of Chicago in the summer of 1950. From 1963 to 1965
she served as director of the computer center at Regis.

For twenty-ﬁve years, 1953–78, Sister Leonarda was director of the Regis College
Research Center and principal investigator for contractual work for the Air Force
Research Center, Hanscom Field. Her work involved mathematical analysis primar-
ily associated with climatology, meteorology, ionospheric studies, and interplanetary
studies. After 1978 she held the title Research Analyst, Institutional Research, at
Regis. She also held the rank professor emeritus after her retirement from teaching
in 1964.

Sister Leonarda Burke received the Outstanding Educator Award from Regis
College in 1975. She was given a special achievement award in acknowledgment
of twenty-ﬁve years service in support of the research mission of the Geophysics
Laboratory of the Air Force on November 15, 1978.

For more than thirty years, Sister Leonarda was a member of the Association
of Teachers of Mathematics in New England. From 1958 she made tape recordings
for the blind of books from a variety of ﬁelds for the Communication Center, Mas-
sachusetts Association for the Blind. One project, for example, involved recording
the six volumes of Andrew R. Forsyth’s Theory of Diﬀerential Equations.

Sister Leonarda Burke died at age ninety-seven at the Bethany Health Care Cen-
ter in Framingham, Massachusetts, in 1998. She is buried in St. Patrick Cemetery
in Natick.
