SANDERSON, Mildred Leonora. May 12, 1889–October 15, 1914.
Mount Holyoke College (BA 1910), University of Chicago (MS 1911, PhD
1913).

Mildred Leonora Sanderson was born in Waltham, Massachusetts, the daughter
of Edna E. Pratt (b. 1862) and Horace M. Sanderson (b. 1856), natives of Mas-
sachusetts. Her father was a ﬂorist and truck farmer. In the census of 1900, there
were four children living of ﬁve born; her siblings were two older sisters, May E.
(b. 1884) and Alice Gertrude (b. 1886), and a younger brother, Ralph H. (b. 1898).
The household also listed two servants from Ireland: a farm laborer and one who
did general housework.

Sanderson attended North Grammar School and Waltham High School, public
schools in Waltham. After graduating from high school as valedictorian in 1906,
Sanderson was a student at Mount Holyoke College until her graduation in 1910.
At Mount Holyoke she earned general honors at the end of her sophomore year
and honors in mathematics when she graduated. The year following her college
graduation Sanderson studied at the University of Chicago as the holder of the
Bardwell Memorial Fellowship from Mount Holyoke. She studied with E. H. Moore,
L. E. Dickson, H. E. Slaught, W. D. Macmillan, G. A. Bliss, and A. S. Gale, and
wrote her master’s thesis under the direction of Dickson. During the next two years
she also studied with F. R. Moulton, E. J. Wilczynski, K. Laves, and A. C. Lunn,
and wrote her dissertation in the area of modular invariant theory, again advised
by Dickson. She received her PhD with minor work in astronomy.

In his 1915 “Tribute” to Sanderson, Dickson described the work she did under his
direction noting that her master’s thesis on generalizations in the theory of numbers
and theory of linear groups “might well have served for her doctor’s thesis; but she
was quite willing to undertake a new investigation in a wholly diﬀerent ﬁeld.” About
her doctoral dissertation he wrote, “This paper is a highly important contribution
to this new ﬁeld of work; its importance lies partly in the fact that it establishes
a correspondence between modular and formal invariants. Her main theorem has
already been frequently quoted on account of its fundamental character. Her proof is
a remarkable piece of mathematics.” E. T. Bell wrote in 1938 that “Miss Sanderson’s
single contribution (1913) to modular invariants has been rated by competent judges
as one of the classics of the subject” (p. 22).

Sanderson was an instructor at the University of Wisconsin during the ﬁrst se-
mester 1913–14 but left in February 1914 when she became ill with pulmonary
tuberculosis. She died at age twenty-ﬁve in a hospital in East Bridgewater, Mas-
sachusetts, the following October. Services were conducted in her family’s home
in Waltham by a paster of the First Baptist Church, and she was buried in Mt.
Feake cemetery in Waltham. Writing a few months later in the Monthly, Dickson
called her his “most gifted pupil.” A Mildred L. Sanderson prize for excellence in
mathematics was established in 1939 and is awarded annually by Mount Holyoke
College.
