CARLSON, Elizabeth. October 2, 1896–November 1, 2000.
University of Minnesota (BA 1917, MA 1918, PhD 1924).

Sally Elizabeth Carlson was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the third of ﬁve
surviving children of six born to Alice (Alise) (Johnson) (1870–1956) and Carl Emil
Carlson (1858–1950). Both of her parents were born in Sweden and emigrated sev-
eral years before their marriage in 1891. Her mother had an elementary school
education, and her father had no formal education, although he was literate in
Swedish and English. He was a stone mason in Minneapolis. Her eldest brother,
Oscar E. (1892–1958), was a salesman, having had some high school and business
college, while her next oldest brother, A. Paul (1894–1973), was an electrical engi-
neer with a BS in engineering. Her sister, Esther A. (1904–1975), with a high school
and Bible school education, served forty-six years as a missionary to Venezuela, and
her youngest brother, Cliﬀord N. (1907–1939), was a lawyer.

In 1913 Carlson graduated as valedictorian from South High School in Minneapo-
lis and remained in that city for her collegiate and most of her professional career
at the University of Minnesota. Even though her parents were not supportive of
her desire for a college education, she received her bachelor’s degree in 1917 and
her master’s degree in 1918, after which she taught at McIntosh High School in
northern Minnesota for nine months. She was an instructor of mathematics and
physics at Knox College in Illinois during 1919–20. Carlson returned to the Univer-
sity of Minnesota in 1920 where she was a teaching assistant in mathematics her
ﬁrst year and remained an assistant until she received her PhD four years later. She
and Carey Morgan Jensen (a male) received the ﬁrst two PhD’s in mathematics at
Minnesota in 1924, both as students of Dunham Jackson in analysis and both with
minors in physics.

Elizabeth Carlson remained at Minnesota until her retirement as professor emer-
itus in June 1965. She was instructor 1924–28, assistant professor 1928–50, associate
professor 1950–63, and professor 1963–65, a pattern very similar to that of Gladys
Gibbens, her slightly older colleague. Carlson taught at Hunter College in the sum-
mer session of 1930, having exchanged positions with a faculty member from there.
In the fall of 1965, just after her retirement, she taught at Macalaster College as
a visiting professor. During her career at Minnesota she taught elementary and
advanced undergraduate courses, was advisor for a number of MA candidates, and
won a Distinguished Teacher Award in 1962. In the late 1930s, she joined with
Raymond W. Brink and Ella Thorp, who together had earlier published a book of
exercises for trigonometry, in producing a set of exercises for Minnesota’s interme-
diate algebra course. She also taught a reading course for advanced mathematics
students during the summers, sometimes with other faculty and sometimes alone.
Carlson published three papers based on her dissertation, two in the Transactions
of the AMS and one in the Bulletin of the AMS. Two decades after she retired,
she wrote that she “considered being a good teacher more important than any
mathematical research [she] might do” (Smithsonian questionnaire 1985). She was
active in the mathematical community through the early 1960s; she was an associate
editor of the American Mathematical Monthly 1927–31, served on the executive
committee of the Minnesota Section of the MAA 1961–62, and refereed for the
Monthly in 1962.

Carlson was an active member of the Evangelical Free Church of America and
helped start the Central Evangelical Free Church in downtown Minneapolis. She
taught Sunday school, was deaconess, and sang in the choir and in a mixed quartet
at the Central Evangelical Free Church, which is now closed. She served as faculty
advisor for the Minnesota Christian Fellowship and for the Inter-Varsity Christian
Fellowship chapter at the University of Minnesota and was active in the faculty
Bible class. She also conducted Bible studies in her home and elsewhere, especially
after her retirement. Carlson traveled extensively throughout the world and retained
her ﬂuency in Swedish.

Warren Loud, a former colleague of Carlson, reported to one of the authors in
an e-mail message on March 3, 1998, that “she was strong and vigorous right up
to retirement and beyond. As an undergraduate she lived about three miles from
campus and always walked both ways every day, (not an easy thing in a Minneapolis
winter!) although when I knew her, she drove to and from the university. I recall
meeting her in downtown Minneapolis in 1984, when she was eighty-eight. She said
she was doing an errand for one of the older ladies in her retirement home.”

Elizabeth Carlson died at the Augustana Home of Minneapolis at age 104 in
November 2000. The following fall the mathematics library at the University of
Minnesota mounted an exhibit, “Elizabeth Carlson, notable alumna.”
