BUCK, Elsie (McFarland). June 3, 1897–January 11, 1984.
University of California (BA 1917, MA 1918, PhD 1920).

Elsie Jeannette McFarland was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the only child of
Lillian (Hope) (b. 1867) and Francis W. McFarland (b. 1863), Missouri natives.
They had married in about 1896 and moved by 1900 to San Francisco, California,
where Frank McFarland was a clerk in a pension oﬃce. In 1910 the family was
living in Covina, in southern California, and Francis McFarland was a high school
teacher. In 1920 they were in Berkeley and he was a clerk.

Elsie McFarland attended high school in Covina and Pasadena, California, before
doing all of her undergraduate and graduate work at the University of California
in Berkeley. She was a member of Alpha Phi social sorority as an undergraduate.
After graduating in 1917, she began her graduate work and received her master’s
degree in 1918. She was a university fellow in mathematics 1918–19 and an assistant
in mathematics 1919–20 before receiving her doctorate in 1920 with minor subject
physics. In September 1920 she presented her dissertation as the ﬁrst speaker at
the university’s newly organized women’s mathematical honor society, Mu Theta
Epsilon.

The next two years McFarland taught mathematics and physics at high schools in
California; she was at Maryville High School 1920–21 and at Newman High School
1921–22. During the years 1922–25 McFarland taught as a part-time instructor
at three schools in the San Francisco area: the University of California 1922–25,
Dominican College in San Rafael 1922–24, and Mills College 1924–25.

In 1925 McFarland moved to the University of Oklahoma as an instructor and
was promoted to assistant professor in 1927. She resigned her position at Oklahoma
in 1931 for personal reasons. She was living with her parents, who it appears had
moved with her to Norman, Oklahoma. She was a visiting PhD at the University
of Chicago in the summer of 1931.

McFarland then moved to Spokane, Washington. In November 1980 she reﬂected
on her situation in an interview conducted by Don Haacke for an oral history project
at Boise State University. “I was teaching and semi-starving at a very small college
in Spokane, known as Spokane University. . . . At any rate, we were not getting paid
very much money. I [taught] my whole nine months there for $360 and a box of
apples and some kitchen cleanser donated by one of the students as part of his
tuition. And I was sending out something like 300 or 400 letters of application all
over the country. This was in 1932 . . . when jobs were very few and far between” (p.
1). McFarland then learned that a junior college was to be opened by the Episcopal
Church in Boise, Idaho, on the site of St. Margaret’s Hall, a school for girls run by
the church.

McFarland joined the ﬁrst faculty of eight at the new Boise Junior College as
a teacher of mathematics and German that fall of 1932, at triple her previous
salary plus room, board, and laundry. After two years the church withdrew its
ﬁnancial support, and the possibility that the school would close loomed so large
that McFarland again sent out applications and accepted a job at Jones County
Junior College, a combined agricultural high school and junior college in Ellisville,
Mississippi. She was there 1934–37 before accepting an invitation from the new
president of the still surviving Boise Junior College to return and teach mathematics
and German.

Initially McFarland taught all the mathematics at the school and later was the
ranking member in mathematics within the Physical Science Division. Her teaching
of veterans after World War II was among the most satisfying of her career. In her
November 21, 1980, interview she noted that “except for the ﬁrst two-year students
at the beginning of the junior college, I never had a nicer group of people than
the veterans. I had big classes; we might have, maybe, a calculus class of 45 or 50
students, the room packed with them. The nicest, most cooperative people to work
with. They knew what they wanted, they’d been out in the war, they were back in
school, they knew what they wanted to do” (p. 13). She also served on many college
committees including those concerned with scholarship standards, scholarship loans
and grants-in-aid, and curriculum.

When McFarland originally moved to Boise, her parents accompanied her. In
1947 she married Roy M. Buck, a civil engineer, who died in 1952. She retired from
the college as professor emeritus in 1968, three years after it was granted four-year
status and renamed Boise College (now Boise State University). She taught an
occasional course after her retirement.

Elsie M. Buck loved music and played clarinet in the college orchestra for many
years. She also purchased and played a grand piano in a room in her home built
to accommodate it. She and a friend made frequent trips to San Francisco for the
opera. She belonged to the faculty women’s bridge club for nearly ﬁfty years. She
was active in, and served as president of, the Altrusa Club and was a member of the
Episcopal church in Boise. She was fond of animals, especially cats; loved to garden;
and owned a small cabin outside of Boise where she spent time in the summer.

Elsie McFarland Buck died of heart failure in a Boise, Idaho, hospital at eighty-
six in 1984. Services were conducted at All Saints Episcopal Church, and she was
buried in Morris Hill Cemetery in Boise. She was survived by two step-children and
a cousin. The list of her heirs attests to her devotion to animals, her church, and
many close friends.
