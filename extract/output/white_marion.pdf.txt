WHITE, Marion Ballantyne. March 28, 1871–January 30, 1958.
University of Michigan (PhB 1893), University of Wisconsin (MA 1906), Uni-
versity of Chicago (PhD 1910).

Marion Ballantyne White was the third of ﬁve children of Jennie E. (McLaren) and
Samuel Holmes White. Her mother was born in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1840 and was
a teacher living in Chicago before her marriage in 1865. Marion White’s father, also a
teacher, was born in New York in 1830 and was a widower at the time of his marriage
to Jennie McLaren. He held a bachelor’s degree from the University of Michigan and a
law degree from the Albany Law School. After ﬁnishing his education he was a principal
of public schools in Chicago and then of the Peoria Normal School. He served in many
important educational positions in Illinois and nationally. He edited the Illinois Teacher for
eight years and was president of the Illinois State Teachers’ Association; he was secretary
of the National Education Association in 1866, 1872, and 1873, and was president in 1874.
He died in 1882. Her siblings were older brothers, Samuel Dexter (ca. 1865–1941) and
James McLaren (1867–1933); younger brother, Alfred Holmes (1873–1953), and sister,
Jennie P. (b. 1876). Marion White was born in Peoria, Illinois, and did her precollege
work in the public schools there.

White was a student at Smith College 1888–89 but left after one year and taught in one
of the Peoria public schools 1889–90. She enrolled in the University of Michigan in October
1890 and graduated three years later, the same year as her younger brother, Alfred. The
two years after her graduation, Marion White taught mathematics in the high school in
Pueblo, Colorado. During 1895–99 and 1900–01 she taught mathematics in the Peoria
high school. In the intervening year, 1899–1900, she traveled abroad with her mother and
sister; the travels included Munich, where she studied in the winter.

Marion B. White was instructor of mathematics at the University of Illinois from 1901
to 1908. While she was at Illinois, the mathematics club was organized in 1902–03, and
the ﬁrst PhD was granted in 1903. White earned her master’s degree at the University of
Wisconsin in 1906 by studying there during three summers. After leaving Illinois she did
her doctoral work at the University of Chicago from 1908 to 1910 and was a fellow her last
year there. While in Chicago, White was living with her widowed mother and her younger
sister, who was a high school teacher. Her dissertation was the third directed by G. A.
Bliss, and White was the ﬁrst student of Bliss who had not begun the dissertation under
the direction of Heinrich Maschke or Oskar Bolza. White’s dissertation in the calculus of
variations appeared in the 1912 Transactions of the AMS; in a 1929 paper in the Bulletin
of the AMS, Marston Morse mentioned her paper, noting that he did not use her results
but thought them interesting.

In 1910 White joined the faculty at the University of Kansas as assistant professor.
While there, she helped with a teacher placement bureau to assist graduates obtain teach-
ing positions in secondary schools. In 1913–14, she was one of three faculty members to
give a paper on integral equations to the department. In his history of the mathemat-
ics department at the University of Kansas, G. Baley Price includes a letter of March 18,
1914, to the dean from the the department chairman who wrote, “The department believes
that Professor Marion B. White is entitled to promotion to an associate professorship on
account of her eﬀective work in the department and in addition on account of her work
and inﬂuence among the young women of the university, as well as her untiring energy
in other lines of university activity” (607). Price also quotes Wilimina Everett Pitcher
who recalls the university in the period 1903–11: “Marian [sic] White may have been an
experiment. K.U. boys were not used to women in the math department. She was there
because [John Wesley] Young brought her. . . . She was a very likable person” (674–75).
Young left Kansas in 1911, only one year after White came and three years before she left.

In 1914 Marion White moved to Michigan State Normal College (now Eastern Michigan
University) in Ypsilanti, where she had been appointed associate professor of mathematics
and dean of women. She served as dean for two years and associate professor four years.
In 1918 she joined the faculty at Carleton College in Minnesota and remained there until
her retirement at age sixty-six in 1937 because of the ill health of a relative. She was
assistant professor 1918–30, dean of women 1922–24, and associate professor 1930–37.
The Carleton alumni magazine notice of her death records that “she was an especially
successful classroom teacher – known . . . for the personal stimulus and encouragement
she gave the students who passed through her classes. . . . She was personally an ardent
participant in the work of many campus and community activities such as the Carleton
Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa and the American Association of University Women.” She
served terms in 1931–32 and 1936–37 on the executive committee of the Minnesota Section
of the MAA.

After her retirement in 1937, White moved to Pasadena, California, where she spent
the last two decades of her life. She died at a local hospital in Pasadena in 1958 at age
eighty-six. She was survived by a cousin in Pasadena and by six nieces and a nephew.
