ANDERTON, Ethel L. September 23, 1888–February 19, 1971.
Wellesley College (BA 1911), Yale University (MA 1922, PhD 1925).

Ethel Louise Anderton was born in Dover, New Hampshire, the daughter of
Isabelle (Richardson) (1853–1937) of New Hampshire and Washington Anderton
(1854–1938) of England. Her father immigrated to the United States and went to
Dover as a fabric colorist to work in the Cocheco Manufacturing Company. Neither
parent attended college, and they married in about 1880. Washington Anderton was
superintendent of the print works from 1880 until his retirement in 1896, after which
he was in real estate. For at least a dozen years in the early decades of the century,
Isabelle Anderton was proprietor of a stationery and variety store in Dover. Their
ﬁrst son, James, was born in 1882 and died as an infant. The surviving children
were Katherine Davis (b. 1885), Ethel, and Thomas R. (1895–1982). Katherine
worked for the telephone company, and Thomas was an electrical engineer with
Westinghouse.

Ethel Anderton graduated from Wellesley College in 1911, after which she taught
in high schools until 1924. She was teaching in Westﬁeld, Massachusetts, in at least
1916 and 1917. The next year she began teaching in West Haven, Connecticut,
and likely continued there until 1924. Also, starting in 1918, she attended Yale
University part time and earned her master’s degree in 1922 and her doctorate in
1925. She received university scholarships part of the time she was at Yale and was
elected to Sigma Xi.

Anderton became an instructor at Wellesley College in 1924 and remained for
three years, after which she taught one year, 1927–28, at Smith College. While at
Smith she was promoted to assistant professor and continued in that rank when
she moved to Mount Holyoke College, where she remained for another three years.
Her last college teaching job was in 1931–32, when she replaced a faculty member
on leave at Goucher College.

In 1933, at age forty-ﬁve, she rejoined the faculty at the high school in West
Haven, Connecticut, as teacher and head of the mathematics department. While in
West Haven, she engaged in work on tests and measurements for the West Haven
school system and was active in various educational organizations. She was president
of the West Haven Education Association and the West Haven Teachers’ Credit
Union, and was a member of the Committee on Teacher Welfare of the National
Education Association. After her retirement in 1954, she engaged in a tutoring
business in college and high school mathematics. In her late seventies, she was still
tutoring an average of three hours a day and went back to teach in high school for
four weeks as an emergency substitute.

In 1941 Anderton had a house built for herself in West Haven and was joined
there by Elsie Schenker, a teacher friend, and, a few years later, by Schenker’s
sister, both of whom lived with her for most of the rest of her life. Anderton’s non-
professional interests and activities included riding, gardening, and conservation;
she was a member of the League of Women Voters, the Connecticut Forest and
Park Association, and was president of a local literary club.

Ethel Anderton died in New Haven, Connecticut, at age eighty-two in 1971. She

was survived by her brother, Thomas R. Anderton, of York Beach, Maine.
