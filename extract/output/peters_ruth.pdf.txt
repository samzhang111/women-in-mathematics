PETERS, Ruth M. December 11, 1906–May 12, 1961.
Bryn Mawr College (BA 1928, MA 1931), Radcliffe College (PhD 1933).

Ruth Margaret Peters was born in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the second of three
children of Julia (Clutz) (1881–1963), a native of Maryland, and Robert John Pe-
ters (b. ca. 1871) of Pennsylvania. Julia Clutz was the daughter of the president
(1889–1904) of Midland College in Aitchison, Kansas, where Robert J. Peters was a
professor of English 1904–09. Julia Clutz received a bachelor’s degree from Midland
College in 1899, graduated from Goucher College in 1901, and, it appears, received
an MA in 1904 from a diﬀerent school.

Ruth Peters’ brother, Robert, was a year older than she; her sister, Mary (1909–
1997), was two and a half years younger. In 1910 the family was living in Pittsburgh,
where her father was a college professor. Her parents had been married for ﬁve
years, this being the second marriage for her father. In the 1920 census her father’s
occupation was listed as educational secretary; in 1930 he was called an executive
with the US government.

Peters attended grade schools in Gettysburg and prepared for college at the Seiler
School, a private school in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The family was living in New
Cumberland, near Harrisburg, when Peters was in college. As an undergraduate
mathematics major at Bryn Mawr, she held the Elizabeth Wilson White memorial
scholarship her senior year. She graduated in 1928; the following year, 1928–29,
Peters worked for the traﬃc engineering department of the Bell Telephone Company
doing trunk analysis.

In 1929 Peters returned to Bryn Mawr for graduate work in mathematics and
physics and studied there as a scholar of the Society of Pennsylvania Women in New
York 1929–30 and as a fellow in mathematics 1930–31. Peters received her master’s
degree in 1931, a year after her younger sister, Mary, received her bachelor’s degree
from Bryn Mawr and the same year that Mary received her master’s degree in
chemistry from Radcliﬀe College.

In 1931 Ruth Peters entered Radcliﬀe College to begin her doctoral work. While
there she wrote a minor thesis on equations of the ﬁfth degree. She completed all
her requirements, including her dissertation in Riemannian geometry, and received
her PhD in 1933. Her ﬁrst position after receiving her PhD in the depth of the
Depression was as a personnel assistant doing job analysis for the Pennsylvania
Emergency Relief Board.

The following year Peters went to Judson College, a small Baptist women’s col-
lege in Marion, Alabama, where she was assistant professor 1934–35 and associate
professor 1935–36. She then took a position as professor of mathematics and physics
at Lake Erie College, also a women’s college, in Painesville, Ohio. She was there
1936–43 and 1945–47. According to an item in the Monthly in 1943, she was granted
a leave of absence from Lake Erie College in order to serve as a research mathemati-
cian with the applied mathematics group at Columbia University. Sometime prior
to June 1943 she submitted a general application for employment to the Bryn Mawr
alumnae oﬃce listing her address as Lake Erie College; on the form she noted that
she was then working as an assistant physicist for the National Defense Research
Council at Harvard and was seeking employment in the Boston area teaching math-
ematics or doing work in physics or statistics. Peters reported later that she was a
technical aide in airborne ﬁre control, guided missiles, and rockets for the Oﬃce of

Scientiﬁc Research and Development at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
1943–45 and that she did research on the theory of errors in bombing.

Two years after returning to Lake Erie College, Peters went to St. Lawrence
University in Canton, New York. She was associate professor 1947–55 and professor
1955–58. While there she served as department chairman for two years. She also held
a National Science Foundation faculty fellowship at Harvard the second semester
1957–58 and was president of the New York Lambda chapter of Phi Beta Kappa
in the late 1950s. In the mid-1950s, Peters indicated that she was a member of the
League of Women Voters and was interested in oil painting and gardening.

In 1958 Peters went to the University of New Hampshire as associate professor.
She was there only two years before she had to take a medical leave in October
1960. Peters’ mother had lived with her from at least 1953, before Peters became
ill. Ruth Peters then moved to her sister’s home in Belmont, Massachusetts. She
died from cancer in a Boston hospital at age ﬁfty-four in 1961 and was survived by
her mother, sister, and brother.

Three years after Peters’ death, Mary Fieser, her sister and coauthor with Louis
F. Fieser of standard texts in organic chemistry, established an award at the Uni-
versity of New Hampshire in her memory. The award description notes that one of
Ruth Peters’ prime interests was discovering outstanding students and encouraging
their development. The Dr. Ruth Peters Memorial Award is given each year to
a student majoring in mathematics who has a deep interest in mathematics and
shows signs of creativity.
