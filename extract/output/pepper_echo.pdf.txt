PEPPER, Echo D. June 3, 1897–January 5, 1979.
University of Washington (BS 1920, MS 1922), University of Chicago (PhD
1925).

Echo Delores Pepper was the second child of Josephine LaBena (Sanderson)
(1872–1930) and Albert Ephraim Pepper (1872–1944). Her mother and father were
born and married in Ontario, Canada. They were in the process of moving to the
United States when her older sister, Leah H. (1896–1966), was born on a Native
American reservation in Canada. Just after Echo Pepper’s birth in Spokane, Wash-
ington, the family moved to Seattle where her parents and older sister remained
the rest of their lives. At various times other relatives lived with them; her father’s
younger sister was with them in 1900 as was his seventeen-year-old nephew from
Canada in 1920. Both parents were trained as accountants, and after working one
year as a bookkeeper in the United States, her father was self-employed and her
mother helped in his businesses. Until the Depression they were very successful run-
ning ﬁrst a plumbing company and a funeral home and, later, hotels and apartment
houses. Echo Pepper’s brother, Vincent A., was born in May 1927. In the 1930s her
father had a sheep ranch outside of Seattle that he traded for an apartment house.
When Echo Pepper was seven, she was ill and lost the use of her right hip, al-
though an operation improved the situation so that she could walk without crutches
by about the time she entered high school. She received all of her education in Seat-
tle until she was twenty-ﬁve. She was taught at home for several years because of
her hip problem. She also attended a convent school, Holy Names Academy, and
then a public high school, Franklin High School, from which she graduated in 1916.
She then attended the University of Washington, where she studied mathematics
and physics under E. T. Bell among others for her bachelor’s and master’s work.
Pepper received her BS in 1920 and held a teaching fellowship in mathematics
there in 1920–22. She received her MS in 1922 with a thesis referred to as having
“exceptional merit” in Constance Reid’s biography of Bell (The Search for E. T.
Bell, 192). In the summer of 1922 Pepper studied with G. D. Birkhoﬀ and L. E.
Dickson at the University of California. In 1922–23 she served as an associate at
the University of Washington, replacing a faculty member who was on leave.

During the years 1923–25 Pepper was a fellow at the University of Chicago. On
August 28, 1924, E. T. Bell, who had taught during the summer quarter at Chicago,
reported to E. H. Moore that “Miss Pepper is wholly absorbed in the topic which
Mr. Dickson assigned her. I believe she is young enough, and suﬃciently ambitious,
to prosper by a chance to study with G. H. Hardy, provided the opportunity be given
her. By the end of this year she should have mastered the rudiments of research.
In my own stuﬀ she has done ﬁne work” (folder 8, box 1, E. H. Moore Papers,
University of Chicago Archives, Special Collections Research Center). Pepper’s work
as a student of Dickson resulted in her dissertation, “Theory of algebras over a
quasi-ﬁeld,” and in 1925–26, the year after her PhD (awarded December 1925), she
studied with Hardy and A. S. Besicovitch at Oxford University as a holder of a
National Research Council fellowship.

Upon Pepper’s return from England she went to Bryn Mawr College as instruc-
tor for the years 1926–28. While there she taught trigonometry, calculus, advanced
calculus, diﬀerential equations, and number theory and taught at both the under-
graduate and graduate levels.

In 1928 Echo D. Pepper moved to the University of Illinois where she remained
most of the rest of her career. She was instructor 1928–29 and associate (similar
to senior instructor) 1929–45. During this period she was active in Sigma Delta
Epsilon, a society for graduate women in science, and served as national treasurer
in 1937 and 1938 and as ﬁrst vice president in 1944 and 1945. Later, in 1955-57,
she served as the business manager of the Pi Mu Epsilon Journal. She also was a
member of the Illinois Academy of Science.

In the summer of 1945 Pepper applied for a leave of absence to be in Seattle for
the year 1945–46, in order to spend time with her family following her father’s death
and also to be in the less harsh climate. The university president denied the request
but indicated that the department might wish to have a formal understanding that
she would be reappointed after the year. Thus, Pepper was in Seattle in 1945–46
and while there taught mathematics and physics as assistant professor at Seattle
College (now University) at the time that her brother was a student there. She
returned to Illinois in 1946 as assistant professor and remained in that rank until
1960.

During the spring of 1952 Pepper had a corrective bone operation and was
granted a leave for the fall semester of 1952–53. From about that time she was
connected with the rehabilitation program at the University of Illinois. She was the
chaperon of a wheelchair basketball team at the university and was later awarded
an honorary life membership in Delta Sigma Omicron, a rehabilitation service fra-
ternity on the Illinois campus.

Pepper taught some summers at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale to
instruct teachers how to teach the “new math.” In the spring of 1960 Pepper was
considering moving to Southern Illinois at a considerably higher salary than she was
making at the University of Illinois. Mathematics department papers show that the
Illinois department chairman’s recommended promotion met with initial resistance
from the dean after which several senior members of her department wrote in her
behalf. She and her teaching were given high praise. It was noted that she had done
much work with the teaching of teachers; also that she “has talent for imparting
enthusiasm for mathematics . . . whether it be elementary freshman mathemat-
ics, calculus for honors students, advanced calculus for engineers, or arithmetic for
teachers.” Other speciﬁc comments were: “I believe that Professor Pepper’s pro-
motion to an associate professorship is long overdue. . . . She succeeds in bringing
the spirit of mathematical creativity into whatever course the department assigns
her to teach.” “Other members of our staﬀ younger and of the opposite sex to that
of Professor Pepper, have had immediate response to their requests for considera-
tion.” She was promoted to associate professor in 1960 and remained in that rank
until she was forced to retire from the University of Illinois in 1965 because of her
age, sixty-eight. She told her brother that she was not promoted to full professor
because Olive Hazlett’s illness had convinced the department that women were too
frail to become full professors.

From 1965 to 1970, after her retirement from Illinois, Pepper was at Notre Dame
University in Nelson, British Columbia, as associate professor and department head.
Her brother reported that she was asked to come to Notre Dame by a student she
had taught at Seattle College twenty years earlier. She was hired on a year-to-year
basis, and her appointment was not renewed the year she turned seventy-three.

According to her brother, Echo Pepper was about ﬁve feet tall and weighed no
more than a hundred pounds. She was completely ambidextrous and could write
with both hands simultaneously. She was a paciﬁst and an Independent but more
Republican than Democrat. She was raised as a “high” Episcopalian but became
a Roman Catholic when she was young. About 1940 she became an oblate of the
Order of St. Benedict, a lay position, having become involved with the Benedictines
through St. Johns University in Collegeville, Minnesota. She was also a member of
the Catholic Daughters of America.

After her second forced retirement, Pepper moved to the Washington, D.C., area
to live in an adult community in Silver Spring, Maryland, near her brother. When
she was past eighty, she moved to the Retirement Living Center at Carroll Manor,
a Carmelite home. She died in the Carroll Manor Nursing Home in Hyattsville,
Maryland, in January 1979 at age eighty-one after numerous strokes. Pepper was
buried at Evergreen-Washelli cemetery in Seattle.
