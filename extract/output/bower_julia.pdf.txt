BOWER, Julia Wells. December 27, 1903–February 19, 1999.
Syracuse University (BA 1925, MA 1926), University of Chicago (PhD 1933).

Julia Wells Bower was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, the second of three daugh-
ters of Maud Estella (Weightman) (1874–1968) and Andrew Park Bower (1869–
1949). Her parents, natives of Pennsylvania, had married on April 10, 1893. They
had attended elementary school, her father through ﬁfth grade. He later supple-
mented this education with night classes and a year at a business college in Reading.
Her mother was a housewife; her father was a cigar maker and a labor leader and
mediator. He was active at the local and national levels of the Cigar Makers’ Inter-
national Union of America and was national vice president for many years and then
president in the 1940s; in the latter role he was editor of the union’s publication.
He was also vice president of the Pennsylvania Federation of Labor for forty years,
and held oﬃces in the Cigarmarkers’ Co-operative Association and other state and
local labor associations. He was involved in many charitable and religious activities
at the community level. These included serving in leadership positions with the
Berks County Tuberculosis Society, with the American Red Cross, and with the
First Baptist Church of Reading. His political aﬃliation was Socialist.

Julia Bower’s older sister, Esther Weightman (1900–1994), held a master’s degree
in child development from Pennsylvania State College and was at various times a
public school teacher, a home demonstration agent, and the director of a child care
center and of the Lancaster, Pennsylvania, nursery school opened by the Harvard
trained educator Psyche Cattell. Bower’s younger sister, Philippa Park (b. ca. 1906),
died in childhood.

Julia Bower attended the public elementary school and high school in Reading.
In 1985 she credited the support she received from her family, including that of an
aunt who taught junior high school mathematics in Reading, for motivating her.
After graduating from high school as salutatorian she went to Syracuse University
as holder of a Reading High School alumni scholarship during her ﬁrst year. While
an undergraduate she served as librarian, secretary, and member of the scholarship
committee of the Syracuse chapter of Pi Mu Epsilon. After receiving her bachelor’s
degree in 1925, she continued at Syracuse one more year as a teaching fellow and
received her master’s degree the next year. While at Syracuse she was elected to
several honorary societies.

In 1926 Bower was appointed to a temporary instructorship at Vassar College
to replace Mary Evelyn Wells, who was on leave to serve as department head at
Women’s Christian College at the University of Madras in India during 1926–27.
The next three years Bower was instructor at Sweet Briar College in Virginia,
where Eugenie Morenus was chair of the department. Bower also was instructor in
the summer school at Syracuse during the summers of 1927 through 1931.

Bower began her graduate work for the PhD at the University of Chicago in
October 1930 and remained there, except in summers, through June 1933. At that
time, she received her degree, having written a dissertation in the calculus of varia-
tions as a student of Gilbert Ames Bliss. She held a fellowship 1931–32 and 1932–33
and taught a freshman course during the ﬁrst quarter of 1932–33.

After receiving her doctorate, Bower went to Connecticut College for Women
in New London as instructor in the fall of 1933 and remained there throughout
her career. The college, established in 1911, became coeducational and adopted

its present name, Connecticut College, in 1969, shortly before Bower’s retirement.
While there she was instructor 1933–38, assistant professor 1938–42, associate pro-
fessor 1942–53, professor 1953–72, and professor emeritus after 1972. She served as
department chairman 1943–69. She taught a broad range of courses for majors and,
after about 1955, for non-majors, later using her 1965 text, Introduction to Mathe-
matical Thought. Her second book, Mathematics: A Creative Art, was published the
year after she retired. From 1961 to 1967 she served as director and as instructor in
NSF in-service institutes for high school teachers that had weekly sessions during
the school year.

Bower had a variety of summer teaching experiences. In the summers of 1943–
46 she was director and instructor of a training course for engineering aides for
the research division of United Aircraft Corporation. She was visiting professor at
Washington Square College of New York University in the summer of 1950 and at
Boston University in the summer of 1954 and was visiting scholar at the University
of Miami in 1962–63.

She was particularly active in the Connecticut Valley Section of the Association
of Teachers of Mathematics in New England (ATMNE). She served as secretary
1941–43, vice president 1949–50, president 1950–51, and director 1951–52. She also
represented her college at a conference on a general curriculum in mathematics
called by the MAA Committee on the Undergraduate Program in Mathematics
and held in New York in 1966. That same year she gave a talk at the Senior High
School Section of an NCTM meeting in Hartford, Connecticut. She was a fellow of
the AAAS.

Bower was a Baptist, was a member of the League of Women Voters, and was
active in Pan-Hellenic and sorority work from the early 1920s to the early 1940s;
she was national president of Beta Phi Alpha from 1936 to 1940. She was at various
times a local oﬃcer in AAUW, AAUP, and Phi Beta Kappa and was also a member
of Phi Kappa Phi and Pi Lambda Theta. She indicated in 1985 that her hobbies
were reading and swimming. Some time after her retirement she moved to Florida,
where in 1984 she wrote a history of John Knox Village of Central Florida, a
retirement community in Orange City.

Julia Wells Bower died in Florida Hospital Fish Memorial in Orange City, Florida,
in 1999 at age ninety-ﬁve. She was cremated and her ashes placed in Mid-Florida
Crematory in DeLand. Before her death, an anonymous donor established the Julia
Wells Bower prize for mathematics in her honor at Connecticut College, which also
presents an annual Julia Wells Bower lecture.
