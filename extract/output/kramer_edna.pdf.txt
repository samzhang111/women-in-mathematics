KRAMER, Edna E. May 11, 1902–July 9, 1984.
Hunter College (BA 1922), Columbia University (MA 1925, PhD 1930).

Edna Ernestine Kramer was born in New York, New York, the eldest of three
children of Sabine (Elowitch) (1879–1958) and Joseph Kramer (1869–1949). Her
parents were born in Austria-Hungary and emigrated from there in 1886 and 1882,
respectively. They had high school educations and were married in 1901. Her mother
was a housewife and her father a salesman of men’s clothing. Her younger sister,
Martha H., born in 1904, graduated from Hunter College and was later a French
teacher; her brother, Herbert E., born in 1911, had a BA and an MA from Columbia
College and was a chemistry teacher. Both were elected to Phi Beta Kappa.

Kramer attended Wadleigh High School in Manhattan and graduated in 1918 at
age sixteen. She later credited Dr. John A. Swenson, her ﬁrst mathematics teacher
at Wadleigh, with inﬂuencing her choice of mathematics as a career. She then
attended Hunter College from which she graduated summa cum laude, ﬁrst in her
class, in 1922. In 1922–23 she taught at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx,
and in 1923–29 she taught at Wadleigh High School, while also doing graduate work
at Columbia University. In her dissertation vita she expressed her indebtedness to
Swenson, of Wadleigh, “for the interest in her which prompted him to arrange her
program of teaching so as to make it possible for her to attend courses at Columbia
University.” She earned her master’s degree in 1925 and her PhD in 1930 with a
minor in physics.

Kramer, with the recommendation of Swenson, obtained a position at Montclair
State Teachers College (now Montclair State University) in New Jersey in 1929. She
remained there ﬁve years: as instructor 1929–32 and as assistant professor 1932–34.
In 1934 she published notes that became her ﬁrst book, A First Course in Educa-
tional Statistics, and she moved to Thomas Jeﬀerson High School in Brooklyn as
teacher and chairman of the mathematics department. The following year, on July
2, 1935, Kramer married Benedict Taxier Lassar, teacher of French and guidance
counselor at Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn. Lassar, born in New York
City in 1906, had received a BA from CCNY, a JD from Columbia, and a Certiﬁcat
d’Etudes Francaises from the University of Grenoble. He later received a master’s
degree from Columbia and a PhD in clinical psychology from New York University.
He remained at Abraham Lincoln High School until 1962. He was also self-employed
and, from 1964, was a staﬀ psychologist at a psychotherapy center.

Edna Kramer-Lassar remained at Thomas Jeﬀerson High School from 1934 un-
til 1956. During this period she did further study, held several other professional
positions, and was engaged in historical research and writing. She studied at the
Center for Research and Graduate Education in Mathematics (later Courant Insti-
tute of Mathematical Sciences), New York University, 1939–40 and at the Univer-
sity of Chicago in 1941. She was instructor in the graduate division at Brooklyn
College 1935–38; mathematics consultant in statistics for the US Oﬃce of Scien-
tiﬁc Research and Development, the Division of War Research, Research Group,
Columbia University 1943–45; instructor at Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (now
Polytechnic University) 1948–53; and instructor in the graduate division at New
York University 1949–50. In 1942, during its second year, Kramer served as the
vice chairman of the Metropolitan New York Section of the MAA. During the war
her research on anti-aircraft ﬁre control was classiﬁed. Her ﬁrst book in history of

mathematics, The Main Stream of Mathematics, was published by Oxford Univer-
sity Press in 1951. In 1952 it was chosen by the Book Find Club, an alternative to
the Book-of-the-Month Club; it subsequently underwent a number of editions and
was translated into Italian, Dutch, and Japanese.

In 1956 Kramer-Lassar left Thomas Jeﬀerson High School. That year she traveled
to England, France, Italy, and Switzerland to interview the women mathematicians
who were the subjects of her 1957 article, “Six More Female Mathematicians,”
written in response to Julian L. Coolidge’s 1951 Scripta Mathematica article, “Six
Female Mathematicians.” She also wrote a survey of mathematics for the Encyclo-
pedia Hebraica, published in Jerusalem 1956–57.

Kramer continued her teaching at Brooklyn Polytech as adjunct professor from
1953 until 1971, when she retired with emeritus rank. She was a consultant on
a special project supported by the NCTM for the University of Oregon in 1963
and participated in the writing of the resulting ten-unit series “Experiences in
Mathematical Discovery” published by the NCTM in 1966. From 1965 to 1969 she
did further study at NYU’s Institute of Mathematical Sciences (renamed Courant
Institute of Mathematical Sciences in 1966), and in 1970 her book The Nature and
Growth of Modern Mathematics ﬁrst appeared. It, too, underwent a number of
later editions and was chosen as a Library of Science Book Club selection. In the
early 1970s, she wrote almost all of the biographies of women mathematicians that
appeared in the Dictionary of Scientiﬁc Biography. In 1972 she was a consultant
to a committee looking to place women mathematicians in Ivy League universities,
and the following year she was lecturer at Nanyang University in Singapore. She
was a member of the New York Academy of Sciences. Kramer’s interests included
music and travel. Also in 1973 she was honored by election to the Hunter College
Hall of Fame, which had been established the previous year.

Edna Kramer-Lassar had developed Parkinson’s disease and suﬀered from a bro-
ken hip more than two years before her death from pneumonia in her home in
Manhattan at age eighty-two in 1984. She was survived by her husband, her sister,
and several nieces and nephews.
