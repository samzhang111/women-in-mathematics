BLACK, Florence. November 22, 1889–September 13, 1974.
University of Kansas (BA 1913, MA 1921, PhD 1926).

Florence Lucile Black was born in Meade County, Kansas, the fourth of ﬁve
children of Mary Ella (Winslow) (b. 1852) and Moses Black (b. 1845), both natives
of Illinois. Moses Black was a land surveyor and rancher. The children were Zada
(b. 1878), Ernest (1882–1949), and Ethel (b. 1884), all born in Illinois, and Florence
and Frances (b. 1891), born in Kansas. Her brother, Ernest Bateman Black, became
a well-known consulting engineer in Kansas City who in 1942 was president of the
American Society of Civil Engineers.

Florence Black grew up on a cattle ranch in southwestern Kansas. She described
her earliest years in “Life on the Cattle Range in the Early Days of Western
Kansas, or Moses Moves to Kansas,” which is included in G. Baley Price’s his-
tory of the Kansas mathematics department (Appendix VII, 736–45). When she
was very young she lived in a large one-room sod house. Her earliest school con-
sisted of her father or sister Zada as teacher, and four students: the two youngest
Black girls and two neighbor children, all four of whom later graduated from the
University of Kansas.

Black attended the University of Kansas in Lawrence and graduated in 1913.
After her graduation, she taught for two years at the high school in Anthony,
Kansas, and for three years at a high school in Wichita. In 1918 she returned to
the university as instructor in mathematics and remained on the faculty until her
retirement. Initially she also took graduate courses and received her master’s degree
in 1921 and her PhD with a minor in physics in 1926, the same year that Wealthy
Babcock earned her doctorate at Kansas.

Having earned her PhD, Black was promoted to assistant professor in 1926. As
was the case with her colleague and friend Wealthy Babcock, she was promoted to
associate professor in 1940. She retired as associate professor emeritus in 1960.

Price notes in his department history that “many will remember Professor Black
best as an outstanding teacher. . . ” (p. 747). Upon her retirement the Florence Black
Excellence in Teaching Award was established to provide a gift to the best teacher
among the mathematics department’s ﬁrst-year assistant instructors. The university
also awards a Florence Black scholarship, and, in its 2005 annual report, the College
of Liberal Arts and Sciences announced the establishment of the Florence Black
and Wealthy Babcock Professorship in Mathematics. Black’s other contributions
to the University of Kansas included her serving as a member of the university’s
committee on scholarships for twenty years, as secretary of the college faculty for
nineteen years, as faculty advisor of the women’s pep club from its founding until
1952, and as treasurer of the Women’s Faculty Club and of the University of Kansas
chapter of Sigma Xi. She was also a faithful attendee at meetings of the Kansas
Section of the MAA.

A paper read by Price at her memorial service noted her many extracurricular
interests: horseback riding, camping, swimming, tennis, and traveling. He said, “In a
recent letter former chancellor Deane W. Malott, now president emeritus of Cornell
University, wrote as follows: ‘I remember once oﬀering her camping rights in the
center of the Cornell campus, should she and Wealthy desire to come’ ” (Price
1976, 747). She and Wealthy Babcock were known, too, for their extraordinary
attendance at football and basketball games at the University of Kansas. She was

remembered twenty-ﬁve years after her death “as a dedicated Jayhawk sports fan”
in the Lawrence Journal-World.

Among her travels were two trips to Alaska. At age eighty she made a trip to
the Mediterranean, Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya. In 1973 Black was elected to
the Faculty Women Hall of Fame by the Commission on the Status of Women.

Florence Black died in Lawrence, Kansas, at age eighty-four in 1974. She was
cremated and her ashes were buried in the Pioneer Cemetery on the University of
Kansas campus.
