BALLANTINE, Constance (Rummons). August 15, 1896–January 14, 1974.
University of Nebraska (BA 1916, MA 1919), University of Chicago (PhD
1923).

Constance Juliet Rummons was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, the daughter of Clara
(Schroeder) (1871–1964), born in Illinois, and Nestor Rummons (1869–1929), a
native of Missouri. Her mother was a homemaker and legal secretary; her father
was a lawyer, who had graduated from Central Wesleyan College in Missouri in
1887 and from the College of Law at the University of Michigan in 1890. A year or
two after their 1895 marriage, the family moved from Lincoln to Elwood, Nebraska,
and in 1901 to Hobart, Oklahoma. Her father was a member of the Oklahoma State
Supreme Court Commission 1915–19. She had two younger sisters, Lucy (1898–ca.
1901) and Helen Lacy (1906–1988), who graduated from the University of Nebraska
in 1925, received a master’s degree in classical studies from the University of Chicago
in 1927, and became a teacher of Latin, Greek, and English in a Chicago high school.
Census records indicate that her parents were living apart in Hobart, Oklahoma, in
1910 and that they were divorced by 1920, when Clara Rummons and her daughters
were living in Lincoln, Nebraska.

Constance Rummons entered the University of Nebraska in 1912 and received
her bachelor of arts degree at the midwinter commencement of 1915–16. She also
took some teachers’ courses and in the summer session of 1916 earned the teachers’
college diploma and the university teachers’ certiﬁcate. She was a graduate student
in 1916–17 and an assistant in philosophy 1917–19 before receiving her master’s
degree in May 1919 in philosophy and English literature. She was a member of the
honorary literary society Chi Delta Phi, and her master’s thesis appeared in the
series University of Nebraska Studies in Language, Literature, and Criticism. Three
years later, a year before she received her PhD in mathematics, Rummons published
a lengthy article in a poetry journal. Rummons was a graduate student, presum-
ably in mathematics, at Nebraska 1919–21 and was also an assistant instructor in
mathematics 1920–21, having studied at the University of Chicago in the summer
of 1920. She returned to Chicago for summer 1922 and the three quarters of the
academic year 1922–23. She received her PhD from Chicago in 1923.

While Rummons was at Chicago, she met John Perry Ballantine, a fellow gradu-
ate student there; they were married at her mother’s home in Lincoln, Nebraska, on
September 21, 1922. J. P. Ballantine was born February 23, 1896, in Rahuri, India.
His father was a medical missionary and his mother was a teacher who had taught
in South Africa. He received a bachelor’s degree from Harvard in 1918 and was an
instructor at the University of Maine 1919–20, at Pennsylvania State College 1920–
21, and at the University of Michigan 1921–22. He, too, received his PhD from the
University of Chicago in 1923, with a dissertation, “A Postulational Introduction
to the Four Color Problem,” directed by E. H. Moore.

In 1923 the Ballantines moved to New York City, where J. P. Ballantine had a
position as instructor at Columbia University 1923–26. Constance Ballantine was
an instructor at Washington Square College, New York University, 1924–25. On
August 31, 1926, the ﬁrst of their three children, Julia Gay, was born in Lincoln,
Nebraska. That same year they moved to Seattle where J. P. Ballantine began
his work at the University of Washington. He was assistant professor 1926–30,
associate professor 1930–38, and professor 1938–66, before his retirement in 1966.

During World War II, he served with the US Army at American military schools
in England and Germany.

The second child, Frederick Winthrop, was born September 18, 1927, and the
third, Charles Standish, on August 27, 1929, both in Seattle. All the children sub-
sequently had professional careers. Julia B. Zalokar became an epidemiologist and
homemaker after receiving her education at the University of Washington; Columbia
University Medical School; University of Washington Medical School; San Diego
State University, where she earned a master’s degree; and the University of Cali-
fornia, San Diego. She died in 1997.

Frederick W. became a computer programmer after attending the University
of Washington and the University of Illinois and earning a master’s degree. He
died in 2006. Charles S. became a mathematician, having received his BS from the
University of Washington and his PhD from Stanford. He retired from Oregon State
University as professor emeritus. He died in 2008.

Within two years of moving to Seattle, Constance Ballantine was given the ti-
tle of associate at the University of Washington. She held the title, which appears
to have carried no speciﬁc duties, at least until 1950. Although she taught some
correspondence courses, according to her younger son, anti-nepotism practices, es-
pecially during the Great Depression, played an inhibiting role in her pursuit of
professional work. However, she did write a review for the Monthly in 1939. When
the children were in school she was active in the PTA. Her hobbies were gardening,
reading, word puzzles, bridge, and Scrabble. She was a member of the University
Unitarian Church.

J. P. Ballantine died of Hodgkin’s disease on March 11, 1970, and Constance R.
Ballantine died in Seattle in January 1974, at age seventy-seven, of complications
of cardiovascular disease.
