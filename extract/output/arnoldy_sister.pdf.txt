ARNOLDY, Sister Mary Nicholas. March 7, 1893–September 28, 1985.
Kansas State Agricultural College (BS 1929), Catholic University of Amer-
ica (MA 1930, PhD 1933).

Catherine Helen Arnoldy, born in Tipton, Kansas, was the eighth of nine children
of Anna (Holz) (1855–1944) and Nicholas Arnoldy (1845–1920). Her mother was
born in Iowa; her father, born in Germany, had emigrated with his family and
settled in Iowa when he was nine. Both attended school through the eighth grade.
They married in Iowa and in 1879 moved to Tipton, Kansas, where her father
was a storekeeper. The ﬁrst child of the marriage, Catherine, died as an infant
in 1877. Her other siblings were John Peter (1878–1959), Elizabeth (1881–1911),
Edward Conrad (1884–1886), George Matthew (1886–1979), Charles John (1888–
1909), Mary E. (1891–1976), and Leo Matthew (1896–1976).

Catherine Arnoldy attended parochial school in Tipton and did her high school
work at the Nazareth Academy in Concordia, Kansas, before entering the Nazareth
Convent in 1910 and making her profession of vows in 1912. All three surviving
daughters became Sisters of St. Joseph. The eldest daughter, Sister Modesta, died at
twenty-nine; Sister Domitilla became a biologist and taught at Marymount College
in Salina, Kansas, where Sister Mary Nicholas was to spend most of her career.

In the seventeen years before she entered the Catholic University of America for
graduate work, Sister Mary Nicholas had various teaching assignments in Kansas;
these included schools in Schoenchen, Emmeram, Antonino, and Manhattan. In this
same period she was doing her undergraduate work. From 1921 to 1923 she attended
the Fort Hays Kansas State Normal School (now Fort Hays State University), and
in 1923–24 she was among the ﬁrst women to attend teachers’ courses at Creighton
University, a Jesuit institution in Omaha, Nebraska. She received her bachelor’s de-
gree from Kansas State Agricultural College (now Kansas State University) in 1929
after studying there during the ﬁrst semesters of 1924–25 and 1928–29 and summer
sessions every summer from 1924 until 1929, except for the summer of 1928 when
she studied at Creighton. She also took one course in music from Manhattanville
College of the Sacred Heart, Pius X School of Liturgical Music, New York, in each
of the winters of 1923, 1924, 1925.

Sister Mary Nicholas entered Catholic University in 1929, received her master’s
degree in 1930, and completed her doctoral work in September 1932 with minors in
physics and education. She then taught for the next thirty-four years at Marymount
College in Salina, Kansas. Founded in 1922 by the Congregation of the Sisters of St.
Joseph, Marymount was the ﬁrst four-year liberal arts college for women in Kansas.
She was director of the mathematics department and, for several years, was the only
mathematics instructor; at various times she was also the college registrar.

After her retirement from Marymount College in 1966, two years before it became
coeducational, Sister Mary Nicholas taught at Sacred Heart High School in Salina;
Notre Dame High School in Concordia; and then worked part time at Central
Catholic High School in Grand Island, Nebraska. She was known for her hard work,
for her love of gardening, and for her mastery of tatting. She was taciturn and had
a very dry sense of humor.

At age eighty Sister Mary Nicholas retired to Medaille Center in Salina. At
ninety she moved back to the Nazareth Motherhouse in Concordia, where she died
