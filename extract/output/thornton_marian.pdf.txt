THORNTON, Marian (Wilder). July 18, 1905–September 30, 1992.
University of Minnesota (BA 1927, MA 1930, PhD 1933).

Marian Augusta Wilder, born in Shakopee, Minnesota, just southwest of Minneapolis,
was the daughter of Minnie Florence (Buchanan) (b. 1870) and George D. Wilder (b.
1866), both natives of Minnesota. At the time of the 1900 census her parents had been
married a year, her father was a sash and door commercial traveler, and they had an
infant daughter, Lois. In 1910 the family was living in St. Paul, her father was a salesman,
and there were two surviving children, Lois and Marian, of three born. They were living
in Minneapolis in 1920 and 1930.

All of Marian Wilder’s university work was done at the University of Minnesota, where
she earned her bachelor’s degree in 1927, her master’s degree in 1930, and her doctorate
in 1933. After she received her BA, Wilder was a high school teacher in Minnesota for
the next two years, 1927–29. She returned to the university in 1929, where she was an
assistant in mathematics 1929–31 and an assistant in biometry 1931–34. Wilder worked
with the noted biometrician and botanist J. Arthur Harris, who headed the Minnesota
botany department from 1924 until his death in 1930; she published three papers with
him. Wilder received her master’s degree in 1930 with a major in mathematics and a
minor in education; her thesis dealt with the mathematical theory of statistics. She then
completed her doctoral work with a major in mathematics and a minor in biometry. She
remained at the university as a graduate fellow in the biometric laboratory 1933–34, the
year after she received her PhD.

Wilder worked as a statistician at the Mayo Clinic 1934–35 and then returned to the
University of Minnesota, where she was hired as a research statistician and instructor for
1935–36. She wrote in her 1937 questionnaire for Helen Owens that she had “been patient
in sanitarium since Nov 1935 ready to begin work again Jan 1938.” She is likely to have
been at the Glen Lake state tuberculosis sanitarium, which was located in Oak Terrace,
Minneapolis, her address on the September 1936 AMS membership list. She was a research
statistician for the committee on educational research in the college of education in the
late 1930s.

Wilder was a statistician with the division of preventable diseases of the Minnesota
State Department of Health from 1938 or 1939 until 1942. Her work in the late 1930s and
early 1940s focused on the use of statistics in medical and psychological data.

On August 27, 1938, Marian Wilder married G. Parnell (Barney) Thornton (1907–
1968). They remained in the Minneapolis–St. Paul area. Her address on membership lists
from ASA and IMS show her living in St. Paul from about 1943. In February 1954,
when she applied for her social security number, she was living in St. Paul and was
a substitute at the College of St. Catherine College in St. Paul. Later Thornton again
worked for the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. In 1966 her name appears on a
list of graduate faculty in the Biometry Division of the School of Public Health, College
of Medical Sciences. In 1970–71 she was listed in the CML, the combined membership list
of mathematics societies, as living in Minneapolis and as being an associate professor at
the university; she does not appear in subsequent lists.

Thornton was living in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, just west of Minneapolis, at the
time of her death at eighty-ﬁve in September 1992. Her husband, Barney, and sister, Lois,
predeceased her. There was a mass of Christian burial at Most Holy Trinity Church in St.
Louis Park, and she was buried in Omaha, Nebraska.
