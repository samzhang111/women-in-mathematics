LITTLE, Dorothy (Manning) Smiley. October 6, 1909–October 18, 1988.
Stanford University (BA 1933, MA 1934, PhD 1937).

Dorothy Manning was the eldest of ﬁve surviving children of Esther Mae (Cran-
dall) (1883–1954), originally from San Francisco, California, and William Albert
Manning (1876–1972), born in Salem, Oregon. Esther Crandall earned a bachelor’s
degree in 1903 and a master’s degree in 1905 in Greek from Stanford and was a PhD
student in psychology there at the time of her marriage in 1908. W. A. Manning
spent a year in Nicaragua with a half-brother before beginning his undergraduate
studies. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1900 from Willamette University in Salem,
Oregon, and a master’s degree in 1902 and a PhD in 1904 in mathematics from
Stanford University. He studied at the Sorbonne during the year 1904–05 and then
returned to the mathematics department at Stanford where, except for a visiting
position, he spent the remainder of his career.

Esther Crandall and W. A. Manning were married on September 18, 1908, and
made their home in Palo Alto. He had a visiting position at the University of
Illinois in 1909–10, and it was in Champaign, Illinois, that Dorothy Manning was
born. There were three more daughters: Rhoda (1912–2006), Helena (1914–1939),
and Sylvia (1917–2005). Twin boys were born in 1920 but died shortly after birth.
The surviving son, Laurence Albert, was born in 1923. The family moved from Palo
Alto to the Stanford campus, an unincorporated area, in 1925.

Dorothy Manning attended public schools in Palo Alto and graduated in 1928
from Palo Alto Union High School. She entered Stanford in the fall of 1928, the
year Marie Weiss received her doctorate in group theory as a student of W. A.
Manning. Dorothy Manning was registered for two quarters in each of the last two
of her ﬁve years as an undergraduate at Stanford and received her BA with great
distinction as a chemistry major in April 1933. The following year she completed
the work for her MA in mathematics, with a thesis in group theory written under
the direction of her father. One year later, in June 1935, her PhD dissertation in
group theory was approved by W. A. Manning and H. F. Blichfeldt, and, for the
committee on graduate study, Ralph H. Lutz. Her dissertation, written under her
father’s direction, appeared in the Transactions of the AMS in 1936, the year before
her degree was granted with a minor in chemistry. During the academic years 1935–
36 and 1936–37 Dorothy Manning was an Abraham Rosenberg research fellow at
Stanford.

Dorothy Manning’s four siblings all attended Stanford. Rhoda entered in the fall
of 1929 and Helena in the fall of 1931. Both studied mathematics and earned BA’s
in 1935 and MA’s in 1937. Like their older sister, both wrote master’s theses under
the direction of their father. Helena died of sleeping sickness in November 1939
after an illness of about a year and a half. Rhoda continued her work at Stanford
and earned a PhD in mathematics in 1941 under the direction of Gabor Szeg¨o. She
was for some time on the faculty at Oregon State University, where she met and
married William H. Wood, a geologist. Sylvia Manning ﬁrst enrolled at Stanford in
the fall of 1935 and studied chemistry for three years. Laurence Manning entered
Stanford in 1940 and earned all his degrees in electrical engineering: a BA in 1944,
an MS in 1947, and a PhD in 1949. He became a professor of electrical engineering
at Stanford.

Dorothy Manning studied at the University of Chicago 1937–38 as a holder of
a prestigious National Research Fellowship; the following year she was a member
of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. In the fall of 1939 she became
an instructor at Wells College in Aurora, New York, and resigned after two years.
The notice of her resignation appeared in the August 1941 Monthly and included
the information that she “has become the bride of Dr. M. F. Smiley of Lehigh
University” (48:489).

On August 20, 1941, Dorothy Manning and Malcolm Finlay Smiley were married
in Chicago. Smiley was born near Monmouth, Illinois, on December 15, 1912. He
did all of his work through the doctorate at the University of Chicago; he earned a
BS with honors in 1934, an MS in 1935, and a PhD in 1937, with a dissertation in
the calculus of variations. He was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study
in 1937–38. In 1938 he went to Lehigh University as instructor and was promoted
to assistant professor before he left in 1942. He also taught as a visiting faculty
member at Chicago for the summers of 1939 and 1941. There were no children of
the marriage.

Dorothy Manning Smiley had no formal employment after her marriage, but M.
F. Smiley was associated with a number of institutions. During World War II he
was in the US Naval Reserve and taught at the Post Graduate School of the US
Naval Academy. He returned to Lehigh as associate professor brieﬂy after the war.
He was at Northwestern University 1946–48, at the University of Iowa 1948–60, at
the University of California at Riverside 1960–67, and at SUNY Albany from 1967
until his retirement in about 1980 or 1981. In 1954–55, he was a faculty fellow of the
Fund for the Advancement of Education, and in 1975 he was an honorary research
associate at Harvard. The focus of his research shifted from analysis to abstract
algebra.

Dorothy Manning Smiley had earlier been elected to Phi Beta Kappa and was
a member of Sigma Xi, a science honor society; Iota Sigma Pi, a chemistry honor
society for women; and Sigma Delta Epsilon, an organization for graduate women
in science. Long after her marriage she coauthored two mathematical papers, which
appeared in the Monthly in 1964 and 1965. In a paper that appeared in the Trans-
actions of the AMS in 1957, M. F. Smiley wrote, “It is with pleasure that the
author acknowledges that certain conversations with his wife, Dorothy M. Smiley,
aided materially in the derivation of the results given in this note” (84:426). He also
acknowledged her “helpful suggestions” in a 1968 paper in the Proceedings of the
AMS (19:1029, footnote). Dorothy Smiley retained her membership in AMS until
the mid-1970s.

In a December 1997 e-mail to one of the authors, Dorothy Smiley was described
by her brother, Laurence Manning, as “the smallest of her siblings (at 5’5”), and
light boned.” He noted that she “had a quiet orderly personality.” He said that “she
spoke quietly but very intelligently. She studied the violin as a child, but wasn’t
very good at it.” He recalled, “Dorothy was 12 years older than I was, so during
the time that we were at home together I was quite young. I used to look to her as
equivalent to an encyclopedia. She seemed to know a lot about many things. My
own interest in radio and electronics can probably be traced back to the seed that
she planted by constructing our family’s ﬁrst radio. I remember hearing a bit of
President Herbert Hoover’s inauguration on her set.”

The Smileys had several moves into new communities, but Dorothy Smiley’s
brother reported that, “she always got involved in local activities, usually quickly
getting a position on some board or other.” She also liked to paint, “and her pictures
were carefully done, and most likely still lifes.”

After 1967 the Smileys lived in the Albany area, and it was there that Malcolm
F. Smiley died in July 1982, shortly after his retirement. After his death Dorothy
Manning Smiley moved from her home to an apartment. Later she met Jess Edward
Little, a retired chemist. On March 26, 1988, they were married in a Unitarian
Church to which they both had connections. Less than seven months later, on
October 18, Dorothy Manning Smiley Little died suddenly after suﬀering a massive
heart attack at their home in Slingerland, New York.
