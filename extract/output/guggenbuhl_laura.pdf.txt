GUGGENBUHL, Laura. November 18, 1901–March 8, 1985.
Hunter College (BA 1922), Bryn Mawr College (MA 1924, PhD 1927).

Laura Guggenbuhl (often Guggenb¨uhl until the late 1930s) was the younger of
two surviving children (of four born) of Emma Marie (Wildhaber) (b. 1867) and
Fritz Guggenb¨uhl (b. 1859), both natives of Switzerland. Her mother had immi-
grated to the United States in 1887, and her father in 1888, about a year before
their marriage. Her brother, Frederick G. W. (1900–1984), was born in New Jersey.
According to the 1900 census, in June of that year the parents and infant son were
living in Saratoga Springs, New York, where her father was a butcher in a hotel.
Laura Guggenbuhl was born the next year in New York City; in 1910 the family
of four was living in Manhattan, and her father was a baker in his own bakery. By
1920 her mother was widowed, and the census report of that year indicates that
the two children and their mother, who was working as a clerk in a bakery, were
still living in Manhattan. Laura’s brother, Frederick, became a physician.

Laura Guggenbuhl attended public schools in New York City before entering
Hunter College in 1918. While there she was a member of the mathematics club
and played basketball. She gave her ﬁrst talk to the Hunter mathematics club at
the end of her ﬁrst year there. By the end of her second year, she had submitted
solutions to problems in the Monthly and about that time organized a “Problem
Chapter” of the mathematics club. She attended Columbia University in summer
1920 and New York University in 1921. She was a teacher in training at Erasmus
Hall High School in Brooklyn January–June 1922 before receiving her bachelor’s
degree with a major in mathematics from Hunter in 1922. She then began her
graduate studies in mathematics at Columbia in summer 1922 in classes given by
W. B. Fite and Dunham Jackson. Guggenbuhl was hired as an instructor at Hunter
for the year 1922–23 before continuing her graduate studies.

From 1923 to 1926 Guggenbuhl studied at Bryn Mawr College, ﬁrst as a graduate
scholar in mathematics 1923–24 before receiving her master’s degree in 1924. She
remained at Bryn Mawr as a resident fellow 1924–26. She continued to teach at
Hunter during the summers and returned to Hunter as instructor in 1926. The
following year she received her PhD in mathematics and education from Bryn Mawr
College as Anna Pell Wheeler’s third dissertation student. While at Bryn Mawr she
also studied with Charlotte A. Scott and D. V. Widder.

Guggenbuhl remained on the faculty at Hunter College until her retirement in
1972. She was instructor 1926–32, assistant professor 1932–59, and associate pro-
fessor 1959–72. Her research interests were largely in the history of mathematics.
In 1950 she published her ﬁrst historical articles: on Gunstock, the home of the
nineteenth-century American astronomer Asaph Hall, and on Euclidean geometry.
Several articles followed as well as entries in the Dictionary of Scientiﬁc Biography
on Henri Brocard and Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach. Between 1966 and 1987 sixty-six of
her reviews, half of which were in history and biography, appeared in Mathematical
Reviews; almost three-quarters of these were reviews of articles in Russian with the
others in German, Italian, and English.

Guggenbuhl reported in the mid-1960s that she had been a consultant for the
Institute of Personality Assessment and Research at the University of California,
Berkeley. She was a member of many professional societies and was a frequent
participant in meetings. She attended the International Congress of Mathematicians

in Zurich in 1932, Cambridge (USA) in 1950, Amsterdam in 1954, Edinburgh in
1958, Stockholm in 1962, Moscow in 1966, and Nice in 1970. She served as oﬃcial
delegate from Hunter College to the congresses in 1932, 1954, 1962, 1966, and 1970.
She made many other trips to Europe as well and reported in Science on two
meetings she attended: the July 1955 Congress of the French Association for the
Advancement of Science, in Caen, and the September 1961 symposium on topology
and its relation to modern analysis and algebra, in Prague. She was a member of
the New York Academy of Sciences.

In 1939 Guggenbuhl reported her hobbies as travel and photography and her
favorite recreations as motoring, swimming, bridge, football, and basketball. She
traveled extensively after her retirement and in 1976 participated in a study tour
to Canton, People’s Republic of China. She was a member of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Opera Guild. She was active in Hunter College
alumnae activities and held a number of oﬃces including treasurer and member of
the board of directors of the Scholarship and Welfare Fund. She was particularly
active in fund raising. At various times she was a member of the committee for
the Bryn Mawr College Endowment Fund; was chairman of the Hunter College
Faculty Committee on Community Funds; and was chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee, which involved fund raising, for the New York City Branch of
AAUW. She was a Protestant. The last several years of her life she lived in White
Plains, New York, as did her brother and his wife.

On May 6, 1985, Laura Guggenbuhl’s sister-in-law wrote to Bryn Mawr College.
“This is a diﬃcult missive to write. . . . Her brother Dr. Frederick Guggenbuhl died
last Sept. 1984. We were overcome with grief and took a 3 mo. round-the-world
cruise thinking it would help our grief. However, it did not and Dr. Laura died
March 8th as the Queen Elizabeth II was leaving Hong Kong. . . . She was a brilliant
woman and a dear kindly person and will be missed greatly” (Bryn Mawr College
Archives, Alumnae Association Files).
