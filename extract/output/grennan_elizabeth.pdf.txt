GRENNAN, Elizabeth (Bennett). October 9, 1880–October 15, 1972.
Ohio University (BS 1903), University of Illinois (MA 1908, PhD 1910).

Elizabeth Ruth Bennett, named Lizzie Ruth at birth, was the daughter of Penn-
sylvania natives Emmeline (Loux) (1852–1923) and Daniel Tinsman Bennett (1847–
1921), who married in 1877. Bennett was born in Shawnee, in Monroe County, in
east central Pennsylvania, the second of seven children. Her father was described
as a miller in 1880 and 1900 and as proprietor of a livery stable in 1910. The other
children in the family were Clara R. (1878–1961), Frank L. (1882–1897), Ida M. (b.
1884), Sarah E. (1886–1924), Lillian M. (b. 1888), and John Loux (1891–1957).

Elizabeth Bennett graduated from the State Normal School in nearby East
Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, in 1898. Her occupation is listed as teacher (unem-
ployed four months) in 1900. She attended Ohio University in Athens where she
received her BA in 1903. She held a scholarship in mathematics at the University
of Illinois in 1907–08 and a fellowship 1908–10. She received a master’s degree in
1908 and her PhD in 1910. Her dissertation in group theory was directed by G. A.
Miller. Bennett’s doctorate was the second granted by the department, and was the
ﬁrst to a woman.

In 1910 Bennett went to the University of Nebraska in Lincoln as an instructor.
Elizabeth Bennett and John Grennan, a faculty member in mechanical engineering
at Nebraska, married in Lincoln on June 12, 1913. John Grennan was born in
Michigan in 1881. In 1910 he was living with his family in Ann Arbor, Michigan,
where he was working as a moulder in a foundry. He attended a summer session
at the University of Michigan in 1911, and that fall he was appointed instructor
in forge and foundry work at the University of Nebraska. He continued to attend
summer sessions at Michigan in 1912 and 1913 and at Nebraska in 1915.

The Grennans remained on the faculty at Nebraska until 1916, when John Gren-
nan took a position as foreman of the forge shop at Michigan Agricultural College
(now Michigan State University) in East Lansing. After two years they both moved
to the University of Illinois. Elizabeth Grennan was appointed instructor of mathe-
matics in September 1918, apparently on a term by term basis. John Grennan was
ﬁrst appointed for twelve months as instructor in foundry practice and manage-
ment in the College of Engineering in July 1918 and was reappointed as assistant
superintendent of the foundry in July 1919 and again in about March 1920. Both
Grennans left Illinois in 1920, and John Grennan went to Camp Grant, an army
training facility near Rockford, Illinois, as an instructor of foundry.

In 1922 John Grennan became an instructor of foundry practice in the metal
processing department at the University of Michigan; in 1930 he revised a previously
published “practical handbook of standard foundry practice” and retired in June
1947 as instructor emeritus of foundry practice.

Elizabeth and John Grennan had no children and remained in Ann Arbor after
his retirement. In about 1940 Elizabeth Grennan reported that she was retired,
her church aﬃliation was Unitarian, her hobby was gardening, and her favorite
recreation was camping.

John Grennan died in November 1964, and a John Grennan scholarship for stud-
ies related to foundry practice or technology in the materials science and engineering
department was established as the result of a $20,000 bequest to the University of
Michigan by Elizabeth B. Grennan. Elizabeth B. Grennan died in Ann Arbor in

the University of Illinois that funds an Elizabeth R. Bennett scholarship in mathe-
matics.
