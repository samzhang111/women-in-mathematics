GURNEY, Margaret. October 28, 1908–March 19, 2002.
Swarthmore College (BA 1930), Brown University (MA 1931, PhD 1934).

Margaret Gurney was the eldest of three children of Anna Elizabeth (Pickett)
(1885–1966) and Dayton Alvin Gurney (1883–1965), both natives of Michigan. Her
parents both graduated from the State Agricultural College in Michigan (now Michi-
gan State University); her mother received a bachelor’s degree in 1905; her father
received a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree. Margaret Gurney noted in a
conversation with one of the authors in 1996 that her mother, who had been good
in mathematics, had gone to college at age ﬁfteen and her father at age sixteen. Her
parents married on September 7, 1907, and Margaret was born just over a year later
in Washington, D.C. Her siblings, John O. (1911–1992) and Ruth H. (1913–1995),
were also born there while her father was an engineer in the US War Department.
He later became chief engineer in the Ordnance Oﬃce. Margaret Gurney’s brother
received a BS degree from the University of Michigan in 1933 and became a mechan-
ical engineer with the US Department of Defense; her sister attended the University
of Maryland and El Camino College in California, married, and had a family.

Margaret Gurney attended public schools and graduated from Central High
School in Washington, D.C., in 1926. She held a White open scholarship for women
at Swarthmore College 1926–30 and graduated with highest honors in mathemat-
ics, physics, and astronomy in 1930. In the 1996 conversation, Gurney, who had
planned to be a Latin major, credited Arnold Dresden at Swarthmore with being
an inspiration for her in mathematics. Gurney studied at Brown University, where
she was a University junior fellow 1930–31, earned her master’s degree in 1931, and
continued her graduate studies as a Joshua Lippincott fellow from Swarthmore Col-
lege 1931–32. Two articles by Gurney appeared in 1932 dealing with convergence
and summability in series.

In 1932–33 Gurney studied at the university in G¨ottingen as a Miss Abbott’s
School Alumnae fellow from Pembroke College, Brown University. While there she
met Hans Lewy, a privat-docent at G¨ottingen, who had received his doctorate
there in 1926. In 1933 Gurney returned to Brown to continue her graduate work.
Lewy also went to Brown at that time. He was a research associate 1933–35 before
moving to the University of California for the remainder of his career. Gurney
worked extensively with Lewy as she completed her work for the PhD in 1934 with
a dissertation in partial diﬀerential equations directed by J. D. Tamarkin. In 1938
Lewy referred to her unpublished dissertation in an article in the Transactions of
the AMS (43:437–64).

Gurney’s ﬁrst jobs after receiving her doctorate were as a teacher in girls’
preparatory schools. She taught at Ogontz School in Ogontz, Pennsylvania, just
northwest of Philadelphia, 1935–36, and at Wykeham Rise School in Washington,
Connecticut, 1936–38.

In 1938 Gurney began her government career, in which she was to work in sta-
tistics with an emphasis in sampling. She passed her civil service examination in
statistics even though she had had no oﬃcial statistics courses. She ﬁrst worked
for the US Bureau of the Budget in Washington, D.C., as statistical consultant
1938–40 and as economist 1940–44. In 1944 she moved to the US Bureau of the
Census, where she was a mathematical statistician until her retirement in about
1973. Much of her work at the census bureau involved planning and implementing

sample surveys in demographic and economic ﬁelds. As part of her job, Gurney
programmed on the ﬁrst Univac I, which had been built by the Eckert–Mauchly
Computer Corporation for the Bureau of the Census, and which became operational
in 1951.

In addition to her work at the Bureau of the Census, Gurney taught a course in
sampling theory as a visiting lecturer at Stanford University in 1952 and worked
many years as a consultant. She served as a consultant in Puerto Rico for the Bureau
of Labor Statistics, US Department of Labor, six times in the period 1961–71.
During the period 1962–76, she was a consultant for the US Agency for International
Development. She was in Thailand in 1962 and the Dominican Republic in 1963.
She gave a workshop in household sample surveys to Latin-American statisticians
in Mexico City from February to April 1965. She was in Brazil in 1971 and 1976;
in Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia in 1968 and 1970; and in Vietnam in 1972. Much
of her consulting work dealt with aspects of agricultural census, sampling, and the
computation of reliability.

Gurney was much honored for her work at the census bureau. In February 1966
she was awarded a US Department of Commerce Silver Medal for “her continuous
contributions to the theory and application of sample survey methods over a long
period” (Amer. Statist. 20 no. 2 (1966): 9), and in 1968 she was elected a fellow
of the American Statistical Association “for distinguished contributions to the the-
ory of recurrent sample surveys, to the measurement of nonsampling errors, and
to training programs of foreign statisticians in sample surveys of their own coun-
tries” (Amer. Statist. 22 no. 4 (1966): 48). Prior to receiving these honors, Gurney
had been active in the Washington Statistical Society, a chapter of the American
Statistical Association (ASA). She served as the secretary-treasurer 1949–53 and
as a representative-at-large to the executive committee 1952–53. She was also a
referee for the Journal of the ASA and was the Washington correspondent for The
American Statistician, the news publication of the ASA.

In the late 1970s Gurney moved to Quilcene, Washington, on the Olympic Penin-
sula, near her sister. She died in Quilcene in 2002 at age ninety-three, survived by
nieces and nephews. Her obituary described her as having an “active spiritual life,”
having attended Episcopal churches in Maryland, in Washington, D.C., and in Port
Townsend, Washington. It also noted that her pastimes included reading mystery
novels, gardening, weaving, knitting, crocheting, and needlepoint, and that she had
been a member of the National Association for Retired Federal Employees, the
Order of the Eastern Star, and the local Grange.
