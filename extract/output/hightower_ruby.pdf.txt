HIGHTOWER, Ruby U. June 17, 1880–May 5, 1959.
Shorter Female College (BA 1896), University of Georgia (MA 1919), Uni-
versity of Missouri (PhD 1927).

Ruby Usher Hightower was born near Covington, Georgia, the youngest of four
surviving daughters of Amarinth (Sims) (1844–1908) and James Richard Hightower
(1846–1933), natives of Georgia. Her father was in the Confederate army during the
Civil War; her parents married in 1869. Two children died as infants. The other
daughters were Minnie (b. 1869), Alma (b. 1871), and Lillie Frances (b. 1874). In
1880 her father was a farmer, and in 1900 and 1910 he was described as a contractor.
Ruby Hightower attended high school in Jackson, Georgia, before completing
work for her bachelor’s degree in the academic year 1895–96 at Shorter Female
College (Shorter College after 1923) in Rome, Georgia. In the twenty-three-year
period between her graduation and the resumption of her teaching career at Shorter
in 1919, she taught and studied at a number of places. She taught at: the grade
school, at least in 1908–09, and high school in Dublin, Georgia; Central College
(now closed) of Conway, Arkansas; Alabama Normal College (now the University
of West Alabama); Cox College, a women’s college in College Park, Georgia, (now
closed) at least 1915–16; Anderson College (now University), then a women’s college
in South Carolina, 1916–17; and Southwest Baptist College and Hardin College in
Missouri. She studied at the University of Chicago in 1899, at the University of
London in 1913, and received her master’s degree from the University of Georgia
in 1919. She was the only one listed as receiving a Master of Arts degree at that
June commencement at Georgia.

After receiving her master’s degree, Hightower returned to Shorter and remained
there, except for a leave of absence in 1924–25, until her retirement in 1947. The
college annual of 1920 notes that she was elected fellow in mathematics at the
University of Missouri for 1919–20. Apparently she delayed her entrance to the
graduate school there until the summer of 1921. She was resident for ﬁve summer
sessions and was granted a leave to study at Missouri 1924–25. She was an honorary
fellow in mathematics for the year and then returned to Shorter as head of the
department. She received her PhD with minors in physics and astronomy in 1927.
While at Missouri she wrote her dissertation in ring theory under the direction of
G. E. Wahlin. According to the Shorter College historian, Hightower was the ﬁrst
Shorter graduate to receive a PhD degree.

During Hightower’s years at Shorter College she was generally the only perma-
nent member of the mathematics department. Her interests included mathematical
astronomy and economics. She wrote in 1940, “My chief interest is in teaching,
and not in research, for which I have little available time” (Owens questionnaire).
After her retirement in 1947, she spent time with relatives in Quitman and Atlanta,
but maintained her apartment on the college campus. She taught part time at the
college 1949–50, 1954–55, and 1956–57, and was emeritus after 1952.

Hightower was tall, slender, extremely soft-spoken, and, according to her obit-
uary in the Shorter College alumni bulletin, “an excellent teacher, thoroughly
grounded in her subject.” She was a Baptist and a Democrat. She had been living
at the college apartments in Rome until a few weeks before her death in Quitman,
Georgia, in 1959. A niece in Quitman and a great-niece in Rome were among her
survivors. The niece was a former dean of Shorter College.
