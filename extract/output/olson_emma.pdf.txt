University of South Dakota (BA 1915), University of Chicago (MA 1924, PhD

Emma Julia Olson was born in Fairview, South Dakota, the fourth of seven
surviving children of Julia (Erickson) (1860–1929) and Sven Olson (1848–1940),
both natives of Norway. Her parents farmed in Lincoln County, South Dakota, near
the Iowa border. She had four sisters and two brothers: Annetta Celia (1883–1955),
Anna Marie (1885–1973), Oscar S. (1889–1968), Nora B. (1894–1984), Henry C.
(1898–1928), and Selma G. (1899–1978).

Olson received her high school and her college education at the University of
South Dakota and earned her bachelor’s degree in June 1915. From 1916 to 1919
she taught mathematics, physics, and chemistry at a high school in Milbank, South
Dakota. From 1920 to 1923 she taught at the College of Industrial Arts, a college
for women in Denton, Texas, which was renamed Texas State College for Women
in 1934 and has been Texas Woman’s University since 1957.

In September 1923 she entered the University of Chicago, studied there for four
consecutive quarters, wrote her master’s thesis under the direction of E. P. Lane,
and received her degree in August 1924. During the second semester of 1924–25,
she was acting head of the department at the River Falls Normal School, which in
1926 became the River Falls State Teachers College, and is now the University of
Wisconsin-River Falls. From 1926 to 1930 she taught at Northwestern University
in Evanston, Illinois.

Olson resumed her graduate work at the University of Chicago and completed
the work for her PhD in 1932 with a dissertation in projective diﬀerential geometry,
again directed by E. P. Lane. She was acting head of the department at Mount Saint
Scholastica College in Atchison, Kansas, during the second semester of 1934–35 and
was assistant professor at Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, 1935–36.

In January 1937 Olson joined the faculty at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio.
She was instructor 1937–40, assistant professor 1940–45, associate professor 1945–
51, professor 1951–63, and emeritus professor after her retirement in 1963. Frances
Harshbarger had come to Kent State a year before Olson and also spent the rest of
her career there.

Emma Olson traveled widely in Europe, Scandinavia, and “the Holy Land.”
After her retirement, she returned to the county of her birth and died at the Good
Samaritan Center in Canton, South Dakota, of pneumonia and congestive heart
failure at age eighty-eight in 1981. She was survived by a sister and nieces and
nephews and was buried in Fairview, South Dakota.
