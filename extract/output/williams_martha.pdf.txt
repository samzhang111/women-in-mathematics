1936, PhD 1939).

Martha Eldora Hathaway was born in Montclair, New Jersey, the daughter of Sarah
Emma (Vaughan) (b. ca. 1885) and Joseph Wood Hathaway (b. 1885), natives of Mas-
sachusetts who married in about 1911. She had younger brothers, Edward W. (1916–1994)
and Vaughan (1923–2003). Her father graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology in 1910 and worked for many years for Western Electric Company in New York
City. In 1918 he described his occupation as electrical engineer and in 1930 as accountant.
Martha Hathaway attended public schools in Montclair and graduated with honors in
mathematics from the high school there in 1931. She then entered Wellesley College, where
she was a Durant scholar and served as president of the Wellesley mathematics club her
senior year, 1934–35. She graduated with honors in mathematics in 1935. On June 19,
two days after her graduation, Martha Hathaway married Herbert Fitz Randolph Plass
in Wellesley, Massachusetts. Herbert Plass was born in Newark, New Jersey, in 1912, and
he earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in physics from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (MIT) in 1934 and 1935, respectively, before entering medical school at
Harvard University.

Martha H. Plass entered MIT in 1935 and ﬁnished her work for her master’s degree
a year later, having written a thesis supervised by George Rutledge. She continued at
MIT, where she minored in physics and where D. J. Struik supervised her doctoral disser-
tation. During the second semester 1937–38 she was an instructor at Wellesley and was
the nominee of Wellesley for its institutional membership to the AMS. In the fall of 1938
she became an instructor at the University of Maryland. In 1939 Martha Plass received
her PhD from MIT and Herbert R. Plass received his MD from Harvard; they also were
divorced that year.

Martha Plass continued to teach at the University of Maryland as an instructor until
1940, when she married Jonathan Wilber Williams and moved to North Carolina. Jonathan
W. Williams was born March 5, 1910, in Olmsted Falls, Ohio. He earned his BS at Baldwin-
Wallace College in 1930 and his MS and PhD in organic chemistry in 1932 and 1935,
respectively, from Northwestern University. He taught at a junior college the ﬁrst two
years after receiving his doctorate and was on the faculty at the University of Maryland
1937–39 and at the University of North Carolina 1939–41. During the war he worked
at the US Naval Research Laboratory 1941–42 and with the National Defense Research
Committee of the Oﬃce of Scientiﬁc Research and Development 1942–45.

Martha Williams was again an instructor at Maryland 1941–43. After the war, Jonathan
Williams worked for the DuPont chemical company 1946–54 and then for the Haskell
Laboratory of Toxicology and Industrial Medicine, established by DuPont, 1954–60. In
1960 he took a position with the patent and licensing division of the US Department of
the Interior.

Martha and Jonathan Williams had two children: a daughter, Susan, born in about
1943, and a son, Jon M., born about ﬁve years later. The family lived in Wilmington,
Delaware, by the early 1950s. Martha Williams was a member of the Canterbury Garden
Club and the Delaware Daﬀodil Society and was president of the Delaware Federation
of Garden Clubs 1962–65. She was president of the Wilmington branch of the AAUW
1961–62.

Jonathan Williams died in June 1970 at the age of sixty. Martha Williams died of heart
failure in St. Frances Hospital in Wilmington in 1989 at age seventy-ﬁve. She was survived
by her two brothers, her two children, and three grandsons. Memorial services were held
in the First Unitarian Church in Sharpley, Delaware. Contributions could be made to the
Delaware Nature Education Society in Ashland, Delaware.
