BEATY, Marjorie (Heckel). January 21, 1906–July 18, 2002.
University of Rochester (BA 1928, MA 1929), University of Colorado (PhD
1939).

Marjorie Louise Heckel was born in Buﬀalo, New York, the daughter of Josephine
Mary (Fisher) (1874–1949) and Henry George Heckel (1875–1943), both natives of
New York State. Her father was manager of a furniture store. A brother, George
Philip, was three years younger than she, became a physician in Rochester, and
died in 1963.

Marjorie Heckel attended grade school and a year of high school in Buﬀalo.
Her family then moved to Rochester, New York, where she graduated from East
High School. She attended the University of Rochester on a state scholarship and
received her bachelor’s degree with a major in mathematics in 1928. She remained
for a year after her graduation to complete her master’s degree. Heckel then went
to Brown University to continue her graduate studies. She was an assistant there
for two years, 1929–31, but had to leave for ﬁnancial reasons.

Heckel took a position as instructor at the University of South Dakota in the
fall of 1931. “She came by train from New York and arrived at a university quite
diﬀerent from the way it is today. For one thing, she and . . . Harry Lane were
the only instructors the mathematical sciences department had. Also, it was a year
of drought in South Dakota when [she] arrived so the campus was very dry and
dusty with only a few buildings compared to how many there are today” (Krebs,
“A century and a half of dedication,” 2). In her second year there she met Donald
W. Beaty (1903–1979), a cattle feeder and farmer who was teaching some courses
at the university. They married on March 30, 1933, and according to Krebs, “her
marriage forced [her] to resign her position at the university because during the
depression only one member of a household was allowed to hold a job” (p. 2).
Krebs reported that the university needed another mathematics instructor during
the year 1934–35, and Beaty volunteered to teach one course for a semester without
pay.

Marjorie Beaty studied at the University of Colorado during 1935–38. It appears
that she was a university fellow and teaching assistant her ﬁrst year, a research
fellow her second year, and a teaching assistant her third year. Her dissertation,
one of four directed by Aubrey Kempner at Colorado, resulted in a PhD in 1939.
The only other Colorado doctorate in mathematics earned by a woman before 1960
went to Laura Louise Johnson (Rosenbaum), Kempner’s other 1939 PhD student.
Beaty and Johnson earned the third and fourth PhD’s given in mathematics at
Colorado.

Beaty returned to the mathematics department at the University of South Dakota
as acting head in 1938–39; she was assistant professor 1938–41 and was acting dean
of women for one semester in 1941. Shortly thereafter she took an extended leave
to raise her two daughters, Debra, born in 1943, and Mary, born in 1944. Beaty
returned to the department as assistant professor in 1955, was promoted to asso-
ciate professor in 1958, and to professor in 1961. She retired in 1976, but taught at
nearby Yankton College for a number of years after her retirement.

In 1965 Beaty delivered the thirteenth annual lecture on liberal education, “Progress

and the Professor,” to the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of South
Dakota. She was a recipient of an Outstanding Educator of America award in 1974.

She spoke at the 1982 summer commencement at the University of South Dakota;
in conjunction with the commencement, her daughters donated funds to the univer-
sity to set up the Dr. Marjorie H. Beaty Mathematics Scholarship to be given to a
mathematics major each year, with preference given to residents of South Dakota.
The university’s Phi Beta Kappa chapter also gives the Marjorie H. Beaty award
to a senior who plans to pursue graduate work there. After her retirement, Beaty
continued her contributions to the university. She served on the board of direc-
tors of the university’s America’s Shrine to Music Museum, helped to create the
Emeritus Club Shakespeare Garden, and was chair of the university’s Centennial
of South Dakota. She and her late husband were awarded the University of South
Dakota Foundation’s Inman Award in 1998 in recognition of their contributions to
the university.

In about 1940 Beaty reported that she was Congregationalist and a Republican
and that her favorite recreation was hunting. Her husband served as a Republican
state senator from 1943 through 1948, and from 1950 to 1976 she served as the
secretary to the Clay County Republican Central Committee. She was a founding
member of the Eta chapter of South Dakota of Delta Kappa Gamma, a professional
honor society for women educators, and received that society’s state achievement
award in 1985. She held memberships in the South Dakota Academy of Science,
Alpha Lambda Delta, Omicron Delta Kappa, Mortar Board, Order of the Eastern
Star, and the social sorority Chi Omega. She also belonged to P.E.O. (philanthropic
educational organization) Sisterhood, a society promoting educational opportuni-
ties for women, and served as president of the local Vermillion chapter; she remained
a member more than ﬁfty years. She joined the AMS in 1929 as a nominee of Brown
University and maintained her membership until her death.

Marjorie Beaty died at the Sioux Valley Vermillion Care Center in Vermillion,
South Dakota, in 2002 at age ninety-six. A service was held at the United Church
of Christ (Congregational), and she was buried in the Bluﬀ View Cemetery in
Vermillion. Beaty was survived by her two daughters, six grandchildren, a nephew,
and two nieces.
