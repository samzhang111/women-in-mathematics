RASMUSEN, Ruth B. March 29, 1899–October 27, 1974.
Concordia College (BA 1921), University of Chicago (MS 1926, PhD 1936).

Ruth Beatrice Rasmusen was born in Moorhead, Minnesota, the ﬁrst child of
Oline (Steen), born in 1876 in Norway, and Robert Rasmusen, born in 1866 in
Minnesota. Her mother had immigrated to the United States in 1892 and was later
naturalized. Her parents married in about 1898. In 1910 there were three daughters
living of ﬁve children who had been born. The other two daughters were Esther
(1902–1974) and Elizabeth (1905–1992). Their father was a barber in Moorhead.

Ruth Rasmusen attended the public schools of Moorhead and graduated from
Moorhead High School in 1918. After three years at Concordia College in Moorhead,
she graduated summa cum laude with a mathematics major and a Latin minor. She
was a member of the Alpha Society, the scholastic honor society there.

For the next four years, 1921–25, Rasmusen taught in high schools in Minnesota
and North Dakota. In the summer of 1925 she enrolled at the University of Chicago
and studied there for ﬁve consecutive quarters before receiving her master’s degree
in September 1926.

Rasmusen indicated in her dissertation vita that she was a teacher at the senior
high school in Muskegon, Michigan, for three semesters in 1927–28, an instructor at
North Dakota State College (now University) in Fargo 1928–29, and an instructor
at South Dakota State College (now University) in Brookings 1929–33. She con-
tinued her graduate work at the University of Chicago, spending twelve quarters
in residence between summer 1930 and summer 1936, after which she received her
doctorate with a dissertation in diﬀerential geometry directed by E. P. Lane. It
appears that Rasmusen was living in her home town of Moorhead for a while af-
ter completing her graduate work. She was appointed instructor at the Platteville
State Teachers College in Wisconsin (now University of Wisconsin–Platteville) and
began teaching there on January 3, 1938.

Rasmusen began her employment with the Chicago Board of Education at Woodrow

Wilson Junior College (now one of the City Colleges) in October 1938. She was
transferred from Wilson to Chicago Teachers College (now Chicago State Univer-
sity) in September 1953. When rank was ﬁrst established there in 1959, she was
made a full professor, one of 18 of the faculty of 137. Rasmusen became the secre-
tary of the committee on promotion and wrote about the ﬁrst few years of the new
policy in the Chicago Schools Journal in 1962. She also contributed book reviews
to that journal.

Rasmusen’s compulsory retirement occurred in June 1964. She then taught at
Kearney State College (now University of Nebraska at Kearney) for the academic
year 1964–65. The Chicago Teachers College became a state institution, Illinois
Teachers College Chicago–South, with a more lenient retirement policy, in Sep-
tember 1965, and Rasmusen returned to work there until her second retirement in
1967.

Rasmusen continued some research in diﬀerential geometry throughout the late
1930s and early 1940s. Her published work includes a joint article in 1941 with
Beatrice Hagen of Penn State, who had also been a student of Lane at Chicago.
Rasmusen served as an associate editor of Mathematics Magazine 1964–68. With
two of her colleagues she wrote a text for use at Chicago Teachers College; in 1960
it was published by Allyn and Bacon, with a second edition appearing in 1965.

RASMUSEN - 2

A proﬁle written at Concordia indicates that she was chairman of the mathemat-
ics department at Wilson Junior College and that she inaugurated the mathematics
contest there. It notes that she also inaugurated the graduate department in mathe-
matics at Chicago State and sponsored Pi Mu Epsilon. She served as a judge at city
mathematics and science fairs, read papers in the Chicago home study department,
and taught by invitation at the Chicago Teachers Review School.

A former colleague described Rasmusen as an excellent teacher. He said she was
tall, slender, lovely, quiet, retiring, with a sense of humor. He indicated that she liked
to travel and was a “rabid” White Sox fan who knew the players’ batting averages.
A former student, who had a course in diﬀerential equations from Rasmusen in one
of her last years of teaching, referred to her as adorable, kindly, concerned, caring,
and stately. She said Rasmusen was ramrod straight and always well-prepared for
class.

In 1970 the Dr. Ruth B. Rasmusen Award was established at Chicago State; it is
given annually to a mathematics major who shows outstanding promise as a scholar
in the ﬁeld of mathematics research. In 1972 she received an Alumni Achievement
Award from the Concordia College Alumni Association.

For many years Rasmusen lived in Chicago with her sister Esther Rasmusen,
who was a biology teacher at a Chicago high school. Esther Rasmusen died in April
1974; six months later Ruth Rasmusen died at age seventy-ﬁve in Minneapolis. She
was buried in Moorhead and was survived by her sister Elizabeth.
