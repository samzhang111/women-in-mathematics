REES, Mina S. August 2, 1902–October 25, 1997.
Hunter College (BA 1923), Columbia University (Teachers College) (MA
1925), University of Chicago (PhD 1931).

Mina Spiegel Rees was the youngest of two daughters and three sons of Alice
Louise (Stackhouse) (b. 1870) and Moses Rees (b. 1858). Her mother was born in
England and immigrated to the United States in 1883, and her father was born
in New York of German parents; they married in about 1892. The older children
were Elsa I. (1893–1975), Albert L. (1894–1993), Clyde Harvey (1896–1967), and
Clarence Eugene (1898–1966). Mina Rees was born in Cleveland, Ohio, but the
family moved to New York when she was a baby, and her early schooling was in
the New York City public schools.

After graduating from Hunter College High School as valedictorian of her class
in 1919, Mina Rees attended Hunter College where she was a mathematics major
and very active in governance. She was president of her freshman and sophomore
classes and, during her senior year, of the Student Self Governance Association.
During her junior year she served as editor-in-chief of the Hunter College yearbook,
the Wistarion. Rees graduated summa cum laude in 1923 and was awarded an “H”
pin as one of the seniors who “distinguished [her]self by signal service to Hunter”
during her four years at college.

After her graduation from Hunter, Rees was oﬀered, but refused, a job at the
college by the then chair Emma Requa, whose only degree was an 1898 BA from
Hunter. Rees related in 1969: “I had formed a ﬁrm opinion when I was an un-
dergraduate that this was a bad mistake that the College was making, employing
people who had just graduated. I felt that the standards of the College were not high
enough and that people should be better educated before they . . . became teachers
there. So, I said I could not under any circumstances, teach at the College because
I wasn’t [well enough educated].” Rees also said that Requa “was appalled at any-
thing like this, so she got me a job at Hunter High School” (Interview by Merzbach,
2). Rees was an assistant teacher at the high school and attended Columbia Uni-
versity as a full-time graduate student. She recalled later that, “when I had taken
four of their six-credit graduate courses in mathematics and was beginning to think
about a thesis, the word was conveyed to me – no oﬃcial ever told me this, but I
learned – that the Columbia mathematics department was really not interested in
having women candidates for Ph.D.’s. . . . That was the only episode that raised a
question about the appropriateness of mathematics as a ﬁeld for women before I
had my Ph.D. It was a really traumatic aﬀair for me” (Dana and Hilton, “Mina
Rees,” 258). Rees’s perception is backed up by the fact that the department granted
only one PhD to a woman, Edna E. Kramer, between 1923 and 1939. Kramer, who
had graduated from Hunter in 1922, received her degree from Columbia in 1930.

After she received her master’s degree from Teachers College of Columbia Uni-
versity in 1925, Rees was hired as instructor of mathematics at Hunter College.
She saved her money and in 1929 took a leave of absence from Hunter to enroll
at the University of Chicago. She chose Chicago because she wanted to study with
Leonard Eugene Dickson, whose 1923 Algebras and Their Arithmetics she had stud-
ied at Columbia. Unfortunately, when she arrived at Chicago, Dickson’s attention
had turned to number theory, so she referred later to her having been “virtually
self-educated” (Interview by Merzbach, 3). On the other hand, Rees’s arrival in

Chicago came at an opportune time for her; within a month she represented the
Hunter mathematics department at the inauguration of the university’s new presi-
dent and as such was one of the guests of honor at a dinner given by the Chicago
department. Rees reported later that soon after that dinner Dickson asked her to
write her dissertation with him. She also reported that Dickson believed that, as
a mathematician, she probably was on a par with C. C. MacDuﬀee. However, she
did not pursue a research career after her degree because, upon reviewing Oskar
Perron’s Algebra in 1933, she did not feel that she was educated properly in the
new Noetherian algebra.

In 1931 Rees completed her dissertation on certain kinds of division algebras,
having had a fellowship her last year at Chicago. After receiving her degree in 1931
Rees returned to Hunter College as instructor. She was assistant professor 1932–40
and became associate professor in 1940. In 1943 she took a leave of absence to
work for the newly established Applied Mathematics Panel (AMP) of the National
Defense Research Committee. She remained oﬃcially on leave until 1950.

Rees described the work of the AMP as “an attempt to enlist the assistance of
civilian scientists outside the military to help the military . . . with weaponry and
speciﬁc work oriented toward winning the war. . . ” (Interview by Merzbach, 5). She
served as a technical aide and executive assistant to Warren Weaver, chief of the
AMP. Rees was with the AMP until 1946, when she went to Washington, D.C.,
to work for the Oﬃce of Naval Research (ONR). At ONR she was head of the
mathematics branch 1946–49, director of the mathematical sciences division 1949–
52, and deputy science director 1952–53. In 1990 a statistician referred to Rees as
“the angel of mathematics” at ONR (Mood, “Miscellaneous reminiscences,” 39).

The signiﬁcance of her role during and just after the war was recognized in a
resolution adopted by the council of the AMS at its annual meeting in December
1953. It reads in part:

The very striking and brilliant contributions made by pure (non-
military, non-applied) science, not least of these by mathematics,
to the winning of World War II is well known. It was clearly seen
by the government and those responsible for the armed services
that a large scale fostering by the U.S. government of fundamental
research, the basis of all research, was unavoidable. . . . Needless to
say as the purest of all sciences, mathematical research might well
have lagged behind in such an undertaking. That nothing of the
sort happened is beyond any doubt traceable to one person–Mina
Rees. Under her guidance, basic research in general, and especially
in mathematics, received the most intelligent and wholehearted
support. No greater wisdom and foresight could have been dis-
played and the whole postwar development of mathematical re-
search in the United States owes an immeasurable debt to the
pioneer work of the Oﬃce of Naval Research and to the alert, vig-
orous and farsighted policy conducted by Miss Rees. The inﬂuence
of these policies has been such that it vitally aﬀected later devel-
opments: the activities of Air Force and Ordinance research, the
National Science Foundation itself. It is well known that in these
more recent organizations Mina Rees was constantly appealed to
for counsel and guidance. (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 60 (1954): 134)

Although the Institute for Mathematical Statistics adopted a similar resolution,
in 1987 Albert H. Bowker, a statistician from Stanford University who had been
chancellor of the City University of New York 1961–72, said that he had “always
thought that Mina and ONR have not been given enough credit for the development
of mathematical statistics in this country” (Olkin, 475). In 1989 Rees was one of
four mathematicians from the ONR awarded the IEEE Computer Society Pioneer
Award.

Mina Rees returned to Hunter College as professor of mathematics and dean of
the faculty in 1953 and became head of a new Oﬃce of Institutional Research there
the following year. On June 24, 1955, she married Leopold Brahdy, a physician
whom she had known for many years. Brahdy was born in Vienna, Austria, in
1892 and immigrated with his family to the United States when he was six. He
later chaired the Metropolitan New York Section of the History of Science Society.
Brahdy died in 1977.

Rees remained as professor and dean until 1961 when the City University of
New York was founded, and she became professor and dean of graduate studies
at CUNY. In the latter position she was instrumental in shaping the nature of
graduate studies at CUNY. She was provost of the graduate division 1968–69 and
was president of the Graduate School from 1969 until her retirement as president
emeritus in 1972. She wrote a report, “The ﬁrst ten years of the Graduate School,
The City University of New York,” the year she retired.

Rees was interested in mathematics education and wrote several articles for the
NCTM journal Mathematics Teacher. During the 1960s she served on several advi-
sory committees for educational projects including one formed by the Conference
Board of the Mathematical Sciences for a course on contemporary mathematics on
the NBC program Continental Classroom. She was also a member of the consultants
bureau of the MAA Committee on the Undergraduate Program in Mathematics in
1961 and served on the steering committee for a study of mathematics curriculum
supported by an NSF grant and reported on at the Cambridge Conference on School
Mathematics in 1963.

Starting in the 1950s, Rees served in a number of important positions in scientiﬁc
organizations. Especially noteworthy were her positions in 1964–70 on the National
Science Board, to which she was appointed by President Lyndon Johnson, and
within the AAAS, where she became the ﬁrst woman president in 1971. Also in
the AAAS, where she was a fellow, she served as vice president 1953–54, chairman
of Section A 1953–54, member of the board of directors 1957–60, and chairman of
the board 1972. Her positions within the ACM included her appointment to the
original executive council 1947–48 and her election to the executive council 1948–
50. For the AMS she was on the nominating committee 1952 and was a trustee
1955–59. In the MAA she was vice president 1963–64, was vice chairman 1955 and
chairman 1956 of the New York Metropolitan Section, and was on or served as
chairman of numerous committees; these included the committee on World War
II History 1981–83. For SIAM she was councillor 1953–56, on the committee on
visiting lecturers 1959–60, representative on the AAAS council 1958–61, and on
the board of directors of the SIAM Institute for Mathematics and Society. She
was councillor 1957–60 for the New York Academy of Sciences. She also served as a
member of the executive committee of the American Conference of Academic Deans
1960–62. She chaired a panel on the level and forms of support in the mathematical

sciences for a report issued in 1968 by the Committee on Support of Research in
the Mathematical Sciences (COSRIMS) of the National Research Council for the
Committee on Science and Public Policy of the National Academy of Sciences. In
addition to her many posts, she often chaired sessions at meetings, symposia, and
conferences and also gave a number of banquet addresses.

Publications by and about Rees are so numerous that we have not attempted to
list them all. Two references to Rees, the 1962 article in the Monthly and the 1987
article by Phyllis Fox in Women of Mathematics: A Bioblibliographic Sourcebook,
list several additional reports or articles by Rees that we have not included; Fox
also lists several references to Rees that do not appear below.

Among Rees’s many honors are at least eighteen honorary degrees from US col-
leges and universities; the King’s Medal for Service in the Cause of Freedom “in
recognition of valuable services rendered to the Allied war eﬀort” 1948 (Bull. Amer.
Math. Soc. 54 (1948): 493); the President’s Certiﬁcate of Merit 1948; MAA’s ﬁrst
award for service to mathematics 1962; Hunter College High School’s ﬁrst distin-
guished graduate 1965; AAUW achievement award 1965; a AAAS Symposium to
Honor Mina Rees, January 1982; and the Public Welfare Medal, National Academy
of Sciences, “for her contributions to the scientiﬁc enterprise, especially in math-
ematics, astronomy and computer science, from wartime, through the transition
from war to peace, and continuing today” April 25, 1983 (NAS Archives). The li-
brary at the Graduate School and University Center of CUNY was dedicated as
the Mina Rees Library in 1985. In 1970 she was also featured in Vogue magazine
as one of nine women described as “Liberated. All Liberated.”

Rees had broad cultural interests that included music, dance, and literature. It
was noted in her 1985 proﬁle in Mathematical People that she was “an accomplished
painter . . . [who] for a time . . . studied in Mexico every year” (p. 257). Later she
went to Maine in summers and painted there. She was a frequent traveler abroad
and made trips to South America and Europe. She was a member of the Unitarian
Church of All Souls in Manhattan for many years.

Mina Rees died at the Mary Manning Walsh Home in Manhattan a few months
after her ninety-ﬁfth birthday. She was survived by a niece, a great-niece, and
grand-nephews. She left $1.7 million to the CUNY Graduate Center to establish a
fellowship and to endow a chair in mathematics. At the CUNY Graduate Center
the Mina Rees Dissertation Fellowships in the Sciences are awarded annually. In
addition, at least one Mina S. Rees Graduate Scholarship in Sciences and Mathe-
matics is awarded annually to students in, or about to enroll in, a PhD program at
CUNY. She is the subject of two doctoral dissertations.
