DIMICK, Alice (McKelden). December 6, 1878–July 13, 1956.
Columbian University (BA 1899), University of Pennsylvania (MA 1900, PhD
1905).

Alice Madeleine (Elsie) McKelden was born in Washington, D.C., the seventh of
nine children of Alice Maria (McIntosh) (1843–1932) and William Blagrove McK-
elden (1842–1905), both natives of the District of Columbia, who married in October
1864. Her father worked for the US Treasury Department and was cashier of the
treasury at the time of his death. Her mother was a teacher in the public schools
of Washington before her marriage. There were seven daughters and two sons in
the family. They were Margaret Vernon Blagrove (1865–1942), a registered nurse;
Clara Alexander (April 1867–July 1867); Edith Parthenia (1869–1941); Louise Beat-
rice (1872–1947); Frederick Eastman (January 2, 1875–February 26, 1875); Mary
(Marie) Christie (1876–1942); Alice Madeleine; William Blagrove Jr. (1881–1938);
and Irma Eldridge (1885–1966).

Alice McKelden graduated from Central High School in Washington, D.C., in
1895. She then received by competitive examination a four-year scholarship to
Columbian (now George Washington) University. She received medals in both math-
ematics and Greek and graduated from Columbian in 1899. She entered the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania as a university scholar in mathematics in October 1899.
During 1899–1900 she took seven courses in mathematics, six in Greek, and one in
classical philology, and passed written examinations in Greek, in modern analytical
geometry, and in complex variables before receiving her master’s degree in 1900.
McKelden studied at Harvard in the summer session 1901 and at Johns Hopkins in
1901–02, although it is not clear what courses she may have attended. In 1902–03
and 1903–04 McKelden was a Moore fellow and a Bennett fellow, respectively, at the
University of Pennsylvania. She ﬁnished her work for the PhD with a dissertation
in the theory of ﬁnite groups in 1905.

After receiving her doctorate, McKelden taught in at least one preparatory school
and at the Philadelphia High School for Girls. On June 12, 1907, Alice McKelden
married Chester Edward Dimick. Dimick was born in New Hampshire in 1880,
received a BA in 1901 from Harvard and an MA in 1907 from the University of
Pennsylvania. He taught in the Louisville School for Boys 1901–03 and at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania 1903–06. In 1906 Chester Dimick became an instructor of
mathematics on the USS Chase with the US Revenue Cutter Service, later the US
Coast Guard. After the wedding, the Dimicks sailed for Europe, where they trav-
eled during the summer. From the time of their marriage, Chester E. Dimick was a
member of the mathematics department faculty at what later became the United
States Coast Guard Academy. He joined the faculty there as a civilian instructor,
and they lived in Baltimore when the academy was in Arundel Cove, Maryland. In
1910 the academy moved to New London, Connecticut, and they lived in the New
London area for the next thirty-ﬁve years. Chester Dimick was later commissioned
a commander and was a captain at the time of his retirement; he served as professor
and dean. A mathematics award in his name was established by Alice M. Dimick
in 1944, and Dimick Hall on the campus of the academy is named for him. There
were no children of the marriage.

Alice Dimick inherited an interest in genealogy from her mother who collected in-
formation on the McKelden and McIntosh families. Dimick’s “black morocco bound

notebook” summarizing genealogical data was the basis of a volume edited for dis-
tribution to the family in 1972 by James L. Frink, the husband of her youngest
sister (McKelden and Dimick, i).

Alice M. Dimick occasionally served as a substitute teacher in the high school in
New London and as a private tutor, but was mainly involved with various social,
church, and civic volunteer activities. She belonged to the social sorority Kappa
Kappa Gamma and was a member of its subdivision of alumnae whose husbands
were in the US military service. She belonged to the Daughters of the American
Revolution, the International Association of University Women, and was involved
with the YWCA. She was president of the New London Unit of the League of Coast
Guard Women, vice chairman of the New London Unit of the Coast Guard League,
and president of the New London Tuesday Book Club.

In addition to her local activities, Dimick served on the national level with the
Girls’ Friendly Society, an international religious, educational, service, and creative
arts group, aﬃliated with the Episcopal Church, for girls and young women. She
served as national secretary in the late 1930s, on the national board of directors,
and as national president; she contributed articles on the society to the society’s
Record. The Dimicks vacationed in Hawaii in summer 1939.

After Chester Dimick’s retirement as head of the mathematics department at
the US Coast Guard Academy in 1945, the Dimicks moved to Tryon, North Car-
olina. Chester Dimick died in January 1956, and Alice Dimick died in Tryon at age
seventy-seven six months later. They are buried at Arlington National Cemetery.
