WEEKS, Dorothy W. May 3, 1893–June 4, 1990.
Wellesley College (BA 1916), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MS
1923, PhD 1930), Simmons College (MS 1925).

Dorothy Walcott Weeks was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the second of three
children of Mary (Walcott) (ca. 1869–1932) and Edward Mitchell Weeks (1866–1959) who
married in 1889. Her mother was born in New York and graduated from the Girls’ High
and Normal School (now Philadelphia High School for Girls), a secondary school, in 1887.
Her father was born in New Jersey and studied art in Philadelphia and at the Corcoran Art
School in Washington, D.C. Later he was a law student at George Washington University,
received an LLB in 1907, and practiced patent law for a time. Primarily, however, he
worked as an engraver, ﬁrst for private companies and then for the US Bureau of Printing
and Engraving.

Her brother, Robert Walcott Weeks (1890–1964), was born in New York City and
received a bachelor’s degree in 1913 and a master’s degree in 1914 from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. Both Dorothy Walcott Weeks and her sister, Ruth Walcott Weeks
(b. ca. 1897), fulﬁlled a longstanding dream of their parents that if they ever had a
daughter she would go to Wellesley. Ruth Weeks, who was described as musical by her
sister, graduated from Wellesley in 1919, three years after her older sister.

The Weeks family moved from Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, to Washington, D.C., in
1900. Dorothy Weeks attended public schools there and graduated from Western High
School, where her freshman and sophomore mathematics teacher, Nannie J. McKnight,
was a Wellesley graduate who had been in the same class as Helen Merrill. Weeks credited
McKnight with stimulating her interest in science and mathematics and enrolled at Welles-
ley College with the intention of studying those subjects. She graduated in 1916 with a
mathematics major, having taken all the courses in physics, mathematics, and chemistry
that were oﬀered, including three full-year mathematics courses from Helen Merrill and
two full-year physics courses from Louise Sherwood McDowell, her mentor and later clos-
est friend. While there she was also a member of the Shakespeare Society and continued
her interest by attending meetings of the society when she lived in the Boston area in
the 1920s. It was through the Shakespeare Society that Weeks had informal contact with
many faculty members including Ellen Fitz Pendleton, president of the college and former
member of the mathematics department, and Louise McDowell.

Until she graduated from college, Weeks had intended to teach high school mathematics.
She wrote in her unpublished memoir “Fun on the Fringes”: “I was shocked to hear that
a classmate who had ﬂunked Mathematics in college was to teach that subject in a high
school! I realized then that this kind of position would not interest me. Financially it
was out of the question for me to do graduate work. There were few assistantships and
fellowships available at that time” (p. 501). She reported that women were then not
being hired by the National Bureau of Standards so she decided to become an assistant
examiner in the US Patent Oﬃce in Washington, D.C. There were six examinations to
pass: mathematics, physics, chemistry, scientiﬁc French or German, mechanical drawing,
and “technics.” She later wrote that “before I passed these examinations and received
an appointment to the U. S. Patent Oﬃce, I registered as a substitute teacher in the
high schools of Washington. . . . The principal of Fairmount Seminary . . . was in need of
someone that fall of 1916 to teach most of the liberal arts courses” (“Fun on the Fringes,”
503). She was hired to teach eight classes, six of which had only one or two students:
chemistry, two algebra courses, plane geometry, beginning Latin, and Cicero and Horace.
She also taught two classes of rhetoric with six and twelve students, one of whom was the
actress Tallulah Bankhead. Weeks described her as “the most outstanding student I had,
not necessarily academically” (“Fun on the Fringes,” 504).

In spring 1917, still having trouble scoring high enough on the mechanical drawing and
“technics” examinations, Weeks was a statistical clerk with the Oﬃce of Farm Management
in the Department of Agriculture. She passed the patent oﬃce exams on her fourth try
(the average number of attempts before passing was ﬁve) and in August 1917 joined one
other woman among the four hundred examiners. She was the third woman to have been
appointed a patent examiner, one having already retired. She also recalled that one did
not have to wait as long as earlier since men were being drafted for World War I. She
continued, “This is one thing that I’ve always resented, that my opportunities have come
through wars, which is no way for women to get their opportunities” (Sopka interview, 6).
In order to qualify for a promotion, which she received, Weeks studied Substantive
Patent Law at George Washington University for a year in the evenings. In March 1918
she applied to Cornell University to study physics and chemistry and was admitted. In July
of that year she was admitted to candidacy for an MA degree with experimental physics
as her major subject and theoretical physics as her minor subject. She studied at Cornell
during the summers of 1918 and 1919. On October 13, 1919, Weeks wrote to the dean of
the Graduate School at Cornell that she had “registered at George Washington University
for an M.S. degree” in physics and wanted her work at Cornell to be counted. However,
it appears that she never attended classes at George Washington. In 1920 she worked for
the National Bureau of Standards, accepting a lower salary but attending classes given
there by the physics faculty of the Johns Hopkins University. She returned to the Patent
Oﬃce in June 1920.

During the summer of 1920, Edwin Wilson, the head of the physics department at MIT,
wrote to the heads of physics departments at several women’s colleges, including Louise
McDowell at Wellesley, seeking to hire assistants. In September 1920 Weeks joined the
instructional staﬀ of the physics laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
as a laboratory assistant in the electrical laboratory; in 1922 she was made an instructor.
She also studied while working at MIT and received her MS in experimental physics in
June 1923. She chose the subject of her master’s thesis because she was assisting Newell
C. Page in his work with x-rays. After receiving her degree she taught college prepara-
tory courses in physics part time at the Buckingham School in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
while retaining her instructorship at MIT. In January 1923 Samuel Stratton became pres-
ident of MIT. Stratton had been director of the National Bureau of Standards and only
allowed women employees there when forced to during World War I. That spring Weeks
began considering leaving MIT. In November 1923 she wrote to Cornell University to
ﬁnd out how much credit she could receive towards a PhD. She learned that no summer
work would count toward residency and that her MIT work would not be evaluated until
after she had registered; she did not return to Cornell. Instead, she attended the Prince
School of Retailing at Simmons College 1924–25 while working at Filene’s and became
a supervisor for women at the Jordan Marsh department store in Boston in 1925 while
still studying. She received a master’s degree from Simmons in 1925. She became hiring
supervisor at Jordan Marsh and remained in that position until September 1927. She then
held a temporary position doing statistical work for a researcher at the Harvard Medical
School.

In February 1928 Weeks returned to MIT for graduate work. She was also a three-
quarter-time instructor of physics at Wellesley College 1928–29. During the summer of
1929 she taught mathematics at her alma mater, Western High School. Although she was
oﬀered a position teaching physics in a women’s college in India, she decided to remain a
student at MIT and in 1929–30 held a Horton-Hallowell fellowship given by the Wellesley
alumnae association. Courses in theoretical physics, by then her real interest, were oﬀered
in the mathematics department. Her dissertation advisor was Norbert Weiner, but she also
worked with D. J. Struik in connection with the matrices developed in her dissertation,
which she described as both physical and mathematical. She received her PhD in 1930.

During the summer of 1930 she worked in Washington, D.C., as an expert technical advisor
to the US Civil Service Commission.

After receiving her PhD, Weeks went to Wilson College, a women’s college in Cham-
bersburg, Pennsylvania, to develop the physics department and serve as the professor
and head. It was only ninety miles from Washington, and early in her ﬁrst years at Wil-
son she frequently drove home to see her family, especially the ﬁrst two years when her
mother was ill. The summer after her ﬁrst year at Wilson she taught mathematics and
chemistry at Central High School in Washington. She spent the summer of 1932 doing
research in Cambridge, England. That summer she attended the International Congress of
Mathematicians in Zurich and the International Federation of University Women conven-
tion in Edinburgh. She traveled to Europe with Louise McDowell in the summer of 1934
and returned to Cambridge for several weeks that summer. The following summer she
returned to MIT and began a research program in atomic spectroscopy. She was not the
only woman who was involved with spectroscopy. In fact, the abstract of Weeks’s papers
at MIT that appears in WorldCat notes that her papers “include material concerning the
MIT ‘Charm School’, the women who gathered together during summer terms to work . . .
in the spectroscopy lab.”

Weeks had become fascinated with spectroscopy several years earlier and thought it was
a subject that could be understood by her undergraduate students at Wilson. She later
explained that it was through Louise McDowell at Wellesley that she “became aware of the
need for continuing growth of the faculty if students were to receive an enriched education.
It was therefore necessary for [her] . . . to continue research, in a ﬁeld not only interesting
to [her] but also readily understood by undergraduates” (1974, 32). Her research was
supported by a grant from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences when she spent
the ﬁrst semester 1937–38 at MIT. Through 1950, except for the war years, she returned to
work in MIT’s spectroscopy laboratory during her vacations and while on sabbatical. This
research led to a 1944 paper in the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society.

During World War II, Weeks ﬁrst taught electricity and mechanics for an engineering
science management war course at Wilson. From 1943 to 1945 she worked as a technical
aide in the liaison oﬃce of the US Oﬃce of Scientiﬁc Research and Development (OSRD)
supervising the British reports section. After the war she returned to Wilson College
as professor of physics and head of the department but continued her position with the
OSRD on a part-time basis through the end of 1946. She was a Guggenheim fellow at
MIT and at laboratories in England and northern Europe 1949–50 and was a consultant
to the National Science Foundation 1953–56. In 1954 she served as secretary, and then vice
president, of the newly formed Central Pennsylvania Section of the American Association
of Physics Teachers.

Weeks retired from Wilson in 1956 and moved to Wellesley to live with Louise Mc-
Dowell (1876–1966), her former Wellesley physics teacher, mentor, and long-time friend.
In Massachusetts Weeks began an eight-year association as a physicist with the Ordnance
Materials Research Oﬃce of the Army Materials Research Agency at the Watertown Ar-
senal. She soon became their technical representative to the Committee on Radioactive
Shielding. From 1956 to 1962 she coordinated a project that developed shielding material
for use against nuclear weapons. In September 1964, two months after she was forced to
retire from her position with the army, Weeks went to the Harvard College Observatory
as a part-time spectroscopist as a member of the NASA-supported Solar Satellite Project.
She stayed there twelve years, until her ﬁnal retirement in 1976 at age eight-three. In
1966–71 she was also a physics lecturer at the Newton College of the Sacred Heart, where
she worked to set up an undergraduate physics major.

Dorothy Weeks and Louise McDowell had traveled together over the years, and they
purchased a summer cabin in the White Mountains in Randolph, New Hampshire, in
1946. Their last European trips together were to Paris in 1956 and to Helsinki in 1959.
McDowell required full-time care from late 1960 until her death in 1966. In 1961 Weeks

bought McDowell’s house in order to ensure that McDowell could remain there; Weeks
subsequently bequeathed the house to Wellesley College.

In 1973 Weeks spoke at a panel, “Change and Continuity,” when MIT commemorated
a century of granting degrees to women. That year she also wrote her memoir “sitting
at the table desk that was Miss [Helen] Merrill’s” (“Fun on the Fringes,” 405). It was
deposited at the American Institute of Physics, Center for History of Physics.

Inspired by Ellen Fitz Pendleton, Weeks was active in the AAUW throughout her career
and received its achievement award in 1969. She joined the Washington Branch in 1916,
when it was still called the Association of Collegiate Alumnae (ACA), and was its treasurer
1918–20. Later she served as president of the Pennsylvania-Delaware Division 1938–40, as
a member of the fellowship awards committee 1944–53, as chairman of the international
grants committee 1946–53, as a member of the college faculty awards committee 1961–64
and 1965–66, and as president of the Boston Branch 1963–67. She was also active in the
International Federation of University Women and was a member of the relief committee
1947–53 and the fellowship awards committee 1954–59. Just before retiring from Wilson
College, she was president of the Central Pennsylvania Section of the American Association
of Physics Teachers 1955–56, having previously been vice president. She was also a member
of the board of corporators of the Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania from 1946 to
1955 and was a member of the Washington Philosophical Society. She was the Wellesley
College reunion chairman several times before World War II and then again for her ﬁftieth
and ﬁfty-ﬁfth reunions. In 1973 she wrote, “Now I have been appointed reunion chairman
for life” (“Fun on the Fringes,” 1508).

Weeks received honorary degrees from Regis College, MIT, and the Medical College of
Philadelphia. She was one of forty-ﬁve graduates to be interviewed on their college experi-
ence for a Wellesley centennial publication, Wellesley After-Images. On May 12, 1980, she
was interviewed for the Wellesley Oral History Project, which retains a tape recording of
that interview. Wellesley’s alumnae association gave her its alumnae achievement award
in 1983 to recognize “her career as teacher, physicist and leader in women’s education”
(Hartmann, “There are Diversity of Gifts”).

In a letter written in October 1986 that appeared the following June under the heading
“Women in physics,” Weeks replied to a series of letters on that topic. She described
herself as “a retired woman physicist who this past May had her 93rd birthday. I retired
when I was 83. I have just attended my 70th class reunion at Wellesley College.” She
described her career and noted that “the responsibilities assigned me were independent of
sex. Education, ability and personality are the important factors that should be considered
when a person is appointed to a position” (Physics Today 40 (6): 15).

Dorothy W. Weeks had been living in Wellesley before she died, following a stroke,
at the Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Massachusetts, at age ninety-seven in 1990.
She was survived by her sister. A memorial service was held at St. Andrew’s Episcopal
Church in Wellesley.
