FRINK, Aline (Huke). March 2, 1904–March 14, 2000.
Mount Holyoke College (BA 1924), University of Chicago (MA 1927, PhD
1930).

Aline Huke was born in Torrington, Connecticut, the elder of two daughters
of Mary Evelyn (Feustel) (b. 1872), of Massachusetts, and Allen Johnson Huke
(1883–1956), from Connecticut. It appears that her parents married in May 1903
and divorced after a few years. Her father had remarried by 1910 and was later in
the building supply business.

Her mother, Mary Feustel Huke, had been a special student in languages at
Mount Holyoke College 1893–95. This classiﬁcation was open without examination
to teachers who were over twenty and who had taught for at least a year. Aline
Huke’s sister, Barbara Allen Huke, was born in Massachusetts in 1905, earned a BS
degree from Massachusetts Agricultural College (now University of Massachusetts
at Amherst), and died in 1927 while a graduate student in microbiology at Yale.
In 1920, Aline Huke, her mother, and her sister were living in South Hadley Falls,
Massachusetts, with her maternal grandmother and her aunt. Her mother was a
public school teacher there.

Huke received her elementary and secondary education in the public schools of
South Hadley, Massachusetts, and attended the high school there 1916–20. She
wrote in 1982 that she “ﬁrst really liked mathematics when [she] studied plane
geometry in high school” (Smithsonian questionnaire). At Mount Holyoke College
she took thirteen courses in mathematics, eight in German, six in physics, and four
in music. She earned sophomore honors and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in her
junior year. During the summer of 1923, she studied education at Columbia before
completing her work at Mount Holyoke and graduating magna cum laude in 1924.
After her graduation from Mount Holyoke, Huke taught physics and algebra at the
high school in Cobleskill, New York, for two years. In the summer of 1926 she took
courses in pedagogy at the New York College for Teachers in Albany (now SUNY
at Albany).

Aline Huke began her graduate work at the University of Chicago in October
1926 and remained through August 1927, when she completed her work for a mas-
ter’s degree with a thesis in mathematical physics, directed by A. C. Lunn of the
mathematics department. During the year 1927–28, she held a resident fellowship
in mathematics at Bryn Mawr College, where she studied with D. V. Widder and
Echo D. Pepper. Huke returned to Chicago in the fall quarter of 1928 and held
a graduate service scholarship for four consecutive quarters. She left Chicago to
take a position as instructor of mathematics at Mount Holyoke College for the year
1929–30. She completed her dissertation in the calculus of variations and received
her PhD from Chicago in 1930.

In 1930 Aline Huke went to Pennsylvania State College (now Pennsylvania State
University) as an instructor of mathematics. On June 3 of the following year she
married Orrin Frink, Jr., who had joined the mathematics faculty at Penn State
in 1928. Frink, born May 31, 1901, in Brooklyn, New York, had earned his BA
in 1922, MA in 1923, and PhD in 1926, all from Columbia University. He was an
instructor at Princeton 1925–26 and a National Research Council fellow at Chicago
1926–27 and at Princeton 1927–28. Except for short periods on leave, Orrin Frink

remained at Penn State for the rest of his career. He was assistant professor 1928–
29, associate professor 1929–33, and professor 1933–69. He was at the Institute for
Advanced Study in 1940–41 and later was head of the department at Penn State
for just over a decade.

Aline Frink gave up her full-time position for several years after her marriage in
1931. Orrin III, the ﬁrst of their four children, was born in 1932. The other children
were: Peter Hill, born 1939; John Allen, born 1941; and Elizabeth, born 1945. Aline
Frink published mathematics papers in 1937 and 1938 and taught as an instructor
at Penn State part time 1936–37 and occasionally, some part time and some full
time, through 1944. She reported in a letter to one of the authors in 1977 that
it was because of the eﬀorts of Helen B. Owens that she was able to continue to
teach after her marriage; Owens’s husband, F. O. Owens, was the chairman of the
Penn State mathematics department. Aline Frink wrote that she had somewhat
annoyed him “by becoming pregnant and giving up the position that he had gotten
for me somewhat in opposition to the administration.” She also noted that Helen
Owens “was thwarted by discrimination against women and determined that the
same attitudes should not be held toward women in the future.”

All but one of the children graduated from Pennsylvania State University. Orrin
Frink III graduated from Haverford College and earned a PhD in Slavic languages
and literature from Harvard before pursuing a career as a professor of foreign lan-
guages and literature; his last position was at Iowa State University. Peter H. Frink
received an MFA degree from Yale and became an architect in Philadelphia. John
A. Frink, became a computer analyst in Wilmington, Delaware, after having grad-
uated with a mathematics major. Elizabeth Frink received an MFA degree from
the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and studied at the Slade School of
Art in London. She lives in Kennebunkport, Maine.

In 1947 Aline Frink resumed her career as a full-time faculty member. She was
assistant professor until 1952, associate professor until 1962, and professor until her
retirement in 1969, after which she was professor emeritus. Orrin Frink was head
of the department from 1949 until 1960. In 1977 Aline Frink wrote that “needless
to say, I wasn’t appointed a full professor during that time.” While at Penn State,
she directed several master’s theses; she published her last research paper in 1960.
Orrin Frink was an assistant chief engineer at the Special Projects Laboratory at
Wright Patterson Air Force Base 1944–45. He was a Fulbright lecturer in Dublin,
Ireland, 1960–61 and 1965–66. During the latter visit, Aline Frink lectured for a
month at University College, Dublin, after she was asked to ﬁll in for the analysis
lecturer who was ill.

Having long had an interest in languages, Aline Frink began to study Russian
in the late 1940s. This, together with her mathematical expertise in the calculus
of variations, resulted in the book translation listed as 1962 below. She began the
study of Chinese shortly before her retirement.

After the Frinks retired in 1969, they moved to a house in Kennebunkport, Maine,
that had been in Aline Huke Frink’s family since 1747. Her obituary indicates that
she was a lifelong summer resident there. Orrin Frink died on March 4, 1988. Aline
Frink was a member of the Congregational church, was treasurer of the Olympian
Club of Kennebunkport and was vice president of the Kennebunkport Historical
Society. She had a strong interest in music, bird watching, and her grandchildren.

Aline H. Frink died at the Kennebunk Nursing Center in Kennebunk, Maine,
in 2000. She was ninety-six. Her obituary notes that she “stayed independent and
strong-willed, driving and living alone” until about a year before her death. She
was survived by her four children and eight grandchildren. In 2006 John Frink gave
Penn State $100,000 in his parents’ memory to create the Orrin and Aline Frink
Trustee Matching Scholarship in the mathematics department.
