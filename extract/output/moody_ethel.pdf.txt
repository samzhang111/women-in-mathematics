MOODY, Ethel I. February 9, 1905–April 11, 1941.
Wells College (BA 1926), Cornell University (MA 1927, PhD 1930).

Ethel Isabel Moody was born in Rushville, New York, the second of two children
of Alice Arminda (Stearns) (b. 1866) and Edward L. Moody (b. 1865), both natives
of New York State who married in 1889 in Rushville. The family lived in Gorham in
Ontario County, New York, about six miles from Rushville. Her father was a farmer,
who in 1921 was president of the Ontario County Sheep Growers Co-Operative
Association, Inc. In the late 1920s he was town supervisor. Her brother, Robert E.
Moody (1897–1992), graduated from Cornell in 1918, the year Ethel Moody entered
Rushville High School. He was a teacher and was, after his retirement, the Gorham,
New York, town historian.

After her high school graduation in 1922, Moody entered Wells College in Aurora,
New York, about ﬁfty-ﬁve miles from her home. Letters dating from the fall of 1922
in her brother’s papers give an indication of her ﬁrst few weeks at college. “I see
right now where I’m going to ﬂunk everything except math” (Robert Moody Papers,
#2473. Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library).
She writes that she likes everything she is taking except history. She also writes that
she likes her mathematics professor, Dr. Hollcroft, who is head of the department,
and notes that there are four in her math class with the others being sophomores
and juniors. In a later letter she mentions that the other girls got C’s on the math
quiz and that she got an A. She also says that she will try out for basketball but
does not think that she will make the team.

Moody graduated from Wells with high honors in mathematics in 1926. Virgil
Synder, who later became her thesis and dissertation advisor at Cornell, wrote a
letter of recommendation for Moody on February 19, 1930, to Eugenie Morenus
at Sweet Briar College. In it he described how he and another Cornell professor
had been invited to conduct the 1926 honors examinations in mathematics at Wells
College. “We sent up a series of ﬁve three-hour papers, together covering all four
years, and after the papers had been written, we read them. Miss Moody, one of
the candidates, was awarded High Honors. I met her and invited her to come to
Cornell, which she did, the following September” (Sweet Briar College Archives).
Moody attended Cornell on a scholarship, wrote a thesis under the direction of
Snyder in algebraic geometry, and received her master’s degree in 1927.

During the summer of 1927, Professor T. S. Fiske, professor of mathematics at
Columbia University and secretary of the College Entrance Examination Board,
asked Snyder to recommend an advanced student to assist in the clerical work
and statistical study of the Board’s ratings. Snyder proposed Moody, who was
appointed, and, as he explained in his February 1930 letter of recommendation to
Morenus, “after two weeks of routine work she was oﬀered the position of director
of this work, in charge of 80 girls.” Moody returned to Wells as an instructor for
the academic year 1927–28, substituting for Evelyn Carroll (Rusk) who was absent
on leave for graduate study at Columbia. During that year Moody taught solid
geometry, college algebra, trigonometry, analytic geometry, calculus, and projective
geometry.

Moody then returned to Cornell to complete her doctoral work. She was ap-
pointed an Erastus Brooks fellow upon her return, and at the end of the ﬁrst year
she was reappointed. Snyder noted in his 1930 letter of recommendation that this

happened despite the fact that “there were several worthy competitors. This is an
honor unique in the history of this Department at Cornell University.” Her ma-
jor and ﬁrst minor subjects throughout her graduate work were algebraic geometry
and mathematical analysis, respectively; her second minor for her doctoral work was
philosophy. Her 1930 dissertation in algebraic geometry was directed by Virgil Sny-
der. Snyder’s 1930 letter continues, “In geometry she has had thorough courses in
Projective Geometry, Advanced analytic geometry of two and of three dimensions,
Algebraic curves, Cremona transformations, and the Theory of algebraic surfaces,
and of mapping. In every course she had done strictly A grade work. The thesis is
on a group of cubic Cremona transformations in space, and is one of the very best
that has been written under my direction.” Moody was the twenty-ﬁrst student,
and eighth woman, to receive a PhD under Snyder’s direction.

Early in 1930 Moody received a letter from Eugenie Morenus, head of the math-
ematics department at Sweet Briar College, a college for women in Virginia, telling
her of an expected vacancy in the fall of 1930. The vacancy was created because
Julia Wells Bower, who had been an instructor there since 1927, was leaving to
resume graduate work at the University of Chicago. Snyder’s letter of recommen-
dation assured Morenus that “with a sympathetic environment,” he was “sanguine
that Miss Moody [would] develop into an unusually good teacher and investigator of
mathematics. . . . She is . . . in vigorous health, of attractive appearance, and pleas-
ing manners, and of a particularly winsome and agreeable personality” (Sweet Briar
College Archives). Moody took the position and spent three years as an instructor
at Sweet Briar.

In 1933 Moody moved to Pennsylvania State College, again as an instructor.
She wrote her mother that “I have so much more sympathy for these kids than I
did for the ones at Sweet Briar” (Robert Moody Papers). Moody spent the last
eight years of her life as an instructor at Penn State. Publications from this period
consist of reviews and a short note in the Bulletin of the AMS. She also contributed
several solutions to the problems section of the American Mathematical Monthly,
two which were published. Moody was active at the national level in Sigma Delta
Epsilon, a fraternity for graduate women in science, and was treasurer in 1939 and
1940.

In the late 1930s, writing for her entry to American Women: The Oﬃcial Who’s
Who Among the Women of the Nation, Moody described her religious aﬃliation
as Congregational, noted that she was a member of the American Red Cross, and
wrote that her favorite recreation was horseback riding and that she was the author
of articles for professional journals. She registered to vote as a Democrat in 1940.
Moody bought an automobile, a 1935 Chevrolet Deluxe Coupe, for $275 in the
fall of 1939. New York and Pennsylvania drivers licenses from then indicate that
she was ﬁve feet four inches tall, weighed about one hundred thirty pounds, and
had gray eyes and light brown hair. At age thirty-six, on April 11, 1941, Moody
died of a fractured skull “when her automobile left a highway near Rushville and
plunged down an embankment” (Obituary). A letter of condolence to her mother
from the dean’s oﬃce in the School of Liberal Arts at Pennsylvania State, notes
that, “In my conversation with other College Oﬃcials . . . I soon learned how much
they feel the loss of Ethel. . . . You can be comforted with the fact that while she
was with us, she was truly a teacher and a character which inspired her students

to the higher ideals of life. She not only taught the higher ideals of life but lived
them herself” (Robert Moody Papers).
