SPERRY, Pauline. March 5, 1885–September 24, 1967.
Smith College (BA 1906, MA 1908), University of Chicago (MS 1914, PhD
1916).

Pauline Sperry was born in Peabody, Massachusetts, the second of three chil-
dren of Henrietta (Learoyd) (b. 1850) and Willard Gardner Sperry (b. 1847), both
natives of Massachusetts. Her mother studied at Abbot Academy in Andover, Mas-
sachusetts, and between 1868 and 1878 served ﬁve years as a teacher and vice princi-
pal there. Her father graduated from Yale University in 1869. Her parents married
in 1879. Willard Gardner Sperry was master of a high school in Massachusetts,
served for many years as pastor at Congregational churches in Massachusetts and
New Hampshire, received a doctor of divinity degree in 1893, was president of Olivet
College in Michigan 1893–1904, and then became a minister in York Beach, Maine.
Pauline Sperry’s siblings were Willard Learoyd (1882–1954) and Henrietta (1889–
1974). In 1885 the Sperrys bought a cottage in York County, Maine, which they
owned for nearly ﬁfty years, and to which they returned every summer. Her brother
earned his bachelor’s degree from Olivet College, was in the ﬁrst group of American
Rhodes scholars to go to Oxford in 1904, earned master’s degrees from Oxford and
from Yale, became a clergyman and writer, and spent most of the latter years of
his life as dean of the Harvard Divinity School. Her sister graduated from Smith
College and became a writer. She wrote a weekly food column for the New York
Times in the 1930s, wrote four books, and was a contributor to women’s magazines.
In 1902 Pauline Sperry began her undergraduate work at Olivet College in Michi-
gan, where her father was president until 1904. She then attended Smith College in
Northampton, Massachusetts, received her BA from Smith in 1906, and spent most
of the ﬁrst few years of her career there. The year after her graduation, she was
a teacher of mathematics at Hamilton Institute in New York City. The next year,
1907–08, she was a fellow in music and mathematics at Smith, where she earned
a master’s degree in music in 1908. Sperry remained at Smith as an assistant in
mathematics 1908–11 and as instructor 1911–12. In 1910 she, her widowed mother,
and her sister, who graduated from Smith that year, were living in Northampton.
In 1912–13 Pauline Sperry was a traveling fellow from Smith.

Sperry then studied at the University of Chicago and received her master’s degree
in mathematics in 1914. She was a fellow at Chicago 1915–16 and received her
doctorate in 1916 with a dissertation in projective diﬀerential geometry supervised
by Ernest J. Wilczynski. Sperry returned to Smith as assistant professor for the year
1916–17. During the 1917 summer session she taught at the University of California
in Berkeley, at that time the only campus of the University of California, and joined
the faculty there as an instructor that autumn.

Sperry remained at the University of California for the rest of her career. She
was instructor 1917–23, assistant professor 1923–31, associate professor 1931–52,
and associate professor emeritus from 1952. When appointed assistant professor,
she was the ﬁrst woman in mathematics in a professorial rank at the University of
California. Sperry taught graduate courses in diﬀerential geometry and supervised
the doctoral dissertations of ﬁve students at Berkeley: William Lawrence Hutch-
ings (1935), Philip Osborne Bell (1936), Raymundo Acosta Favila (1939), David
Bliss Dekker (1948), and Ting-Kwan Pan (1949). She was on leave the ﬁrst half of
1938–39 and was in Europe some of that time. During her sabbatical in the spring

of 1949, Sperry was in Carmel, California, where she had spent many summers
during at least the previous two decades. In addition to her regular undergraduate
and graduate teaching, in August 1943 she taught navigation to the University of
California Navy ROTC.

In April 1920 the upper class and graduate women mathematics students at the
University of California formed a mathematics club, Mu Theta Epsilon, that had
as one of its aims improved cooperation among students and faculty. All of the
faculty were honorary members but the students chose Pauline Sperry as their one
active faculty member. Although the latest mention of this club, described in 1925
as a women’s mathematics honor society, to appear in the American Mathematical
Monthly was in January 1928, Sperry’s mentoring of other women did not end
then, and, at least in the 1940s, she would take women graduate students to lunch
in the Women’s Faculty Club. She was also involved in the MAA, and served as vice
chairman 1944–45 and then chairman 1945–46 of the Northern California Section.
Although Sperry is listed as being an associate professor 1931–52, she did not
serve as such 1950–52. Sperry was among the thirty-one professors dismissed from
the university in July 1950 because they would not sign a loyalty oath aﬃrming
“that I am not a member of the Communist Party or any other organization which
advocates the overthrow of the Government by force or violence” (Gardner, Cal-
ifornia Oath Controversy, 155). It was later reported that Sperry’s “concern, and
thus her refusal to sign, centered on the damage to the free and open atmosphere of
the university that followed the requirement of the oath” (Innis, “Lessons from the
Controversy over the Loyalty Oath,” 355). In October 1952 the California Supreme
Court ordered that the non-signers be reappointed and Sperry was given the rank
associate professor emeritus as of July 1952; further litigation brought her back pay
for 1950–52 in 1956.

Sperry was always proud of the stand she took in 1950 and explained in her
1965 article, “Formula for happiness at eighty,” in the Smith Alumnae Quarterly
that she “had always burned for causes” (p. 154). She reiterated her commitment
to civil liberties and noted that part of her formula “is summed up in this phrase:
‘Frugal spending and extravagant giving’ ” (p. 155); she also described many of the
good deeds that represent her adherence to this part of the formula.

During her years at the University of California and possibly for some years
before, Sperry had a close friend in Alice Tabor (1878–1959), who had gone to the
University of California in 1916, a year before Sperry joined the faculty. Tabor had
also been a graduate student at the University of Chicago and earned a master’s
degree from there in 1913 and a PhD in 1916, before joining the German department
at California. For many years, starting at least by 1920, Sperry lived with Alice
Tabor and Tabor’s mother in Berkeley; Tabor’s mother died in 1948, the year
that Alice Tabor retired from the university, and Sperry and Tabor continued to
share a residence in Berkeley. At some point, by the early 1930s, they had built a
home in Carmel, California, on the Monterey Peninsula, in which they spent many
summers, and to which they moved permanently in 1950. The 1960 obituary of
Alice Tabor by Sperry and others noted that at the University of California Tabor
had “conceived the idea of the Friday Dinner Club, a group of faculty women who
gathered monthly for many years to share their widespread and varied interests
in research” (1960, 50). The oﬃcial Faculty Women’s Club was organized in 1919
with Sperry and Tabor responsible for the ﬁnances and with Tabor as treasurer

of the building committee. The clubhouse opened in 1923, and Sperry served as
director of the club 1926–28.

After she retired to Carmel, Sperry was active in the Monterey Peninsula Friends’
Meeting, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the American Friends Com-
mittee on Legislation, the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy (SANE), and the
League of Women Voters. Sperry’s own religious beliefs and political commitments
may have been reinforced by her friendship with Tabor, who had a “deep concern for
human welfare [that] was a natural inheritance from a long line of Quaker ancestors
who as abolitionists had sheltered slaves escaping to Canada, helped revolutionize
the treatment of the mentally ill, and pioneered in prison reform and in the Woman
Suﬀrage Movement” (1960, 50). Sperry reported to Smith College in 1957 that she
had been active in the local Democratic headquarters in the recent election. She
was in London in the summer of 1959.

In early 1961 Sperry reported that she had sold her home in Carmel and moved
to Forest Hill Manor, a retirement community in Paciﬁc Grove, California. That
same year she received the Olivet College distinguished alumni award. She reported
to Smith in February 1963 that she had broken her arm; a year later she noted that
she had made a three-month trip to England and New York by freighter. In April
1964 Sperry reported as her chief interest the Step-by-Step School for impoverished
children in Haiti. In 1967 Pauline Sperry died in Paciﬁc Grove at the age of eighty-
two.
