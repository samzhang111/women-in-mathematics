NEWSON, Mary (Winston). August 7, 1869–December 5, 1959.
University of Wisconsin (BA 1889), Georg-August-Universit¨at G¨ottingen (PhD
1897).

Mary Frances Winston was born in Forreston, Illinois, the fourth of eight chil-
dren of Caroline Eliza (Mumford) (1836–1909), who was born in Pennsylvania,
and Thomas Winston (1829–1928), who was born in Wales and immigrated to the
United States when he was two years old. Mary Winston’s parents married in Illi-
nois in December 1861. Her father was a physician trained in a six-week course at
Rush Medical School in Chicago, and her mother, who had taught French, art, and
mathematics at various schools in the East and in Illinois, prepared the children
for college. Her mother learned geology though a correspondence course with the
Field Museum in Chicago and learned Greek on her own in order to teach it to
her children. Winston’s father, who had served in the Union army as a surgeon
during the Civil War, had taken advantage of the government’s oﬀer to sell land
to former oﬃcers and bought about 3000 acres, mostly in Nebraska, some of which
he would sell when his income was not suﬃcient to pay for his children’s college
tuition. The family lived in Forreston, in northern Illinois, until 1892 when they
moved to Chicago.

Winston’s older siblings were Edward Mumford (1862–1948), Thomas Winﬁeld
(1865–1926), and Ambrose Par´e (1867–1959). Her younger siblings were Eugenia
(1871–1956), Milton (1873–74), Charles Sumner (1876–1928), and Alice (1878–
1943). Edward, the eldest child, graduated from Harvard in 1884, received an
LLB degree from Wisconsin in 1888, and became a lawyer who was in business
in Chicago. Winﬁeld was a graduate of the US Military Academy at West Point
and was in the army at the Presidio in 1893–95, where he guarded the Southern
Paciﬁc Railway during the 1894 railroad strikes. He indicated then that he expected
to take the bar exam. It appears that he made a career in the military; in 1910 he
was an army oﬃcer living with has wife and ﬁve children in Virginia. Ambrose Par´e
received a bachelor’s degree from Wisconsin in 1887 and studied at Johns Hopkins
University and the University of Chicago before earning a PhD in political science
in 1900 at Cornell University. He specialized in political economy and was later a
professor of economics at the University of Texas in Austin. Eugenia received a BA
from Wisconsin in 1890. During most of the 1890s the younger siblings, Eugenia,
Charles, and Alice, all lived at home, and all did some studies at the University of
Chicago. Charles and Alice earned bachelor’s degrees in 1896 and 1898, respectively;
and Eugenia and Alice earned master’s degrees in 1897 and 1903, respectively. Eu-
genia was a teacher before her marriage; Charles became an engineer; and Alice
taught English at the University of Kansas starting in 1909.

In 1884 Mary Frances Winston, known to her family and friends as May, and her
older brother Par´e enrolled at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, eighty-ﬁve
miles from Forreston. She interrupted her studies to teach one year in a country
school before returning to Wisconsin and graduating in 1889 with honors in math-
ematics. During at least her last year at Wisconsin, her younger sister Eugenia
was also enrolled there, and both were members of one of the two campus ladies’
literary societies. Mary Winston wrote a senior thesis on “Integrating factors of
diﬀerential equations” and wanted to attend graduate school at Wisconsin. She
was denied a fellowship, and so in 1889 she accepted a job teaching mathematics

at Wisconsin Female College in Fox Lake. That year the name of the college was
changed to Downer College; in 1895 it took over the campus of Milwaukee College
and changed its name to Milwaukee-Downer College. Her ﬁrst year she applied to
the mathematics program at Bryn Mawr College but was turned down for a fel-
lowship, which was given instead to Ruth Gentry. However, when Gentry received
a European fellowship from the Association for Collegiate Alumnae (ACA) for the
following year, Scott telegraphed Winston to suggest she apply again. This time
Winston was successful, and in 1891–92 she was a graduate fellow at Bryn Mawr
where she studied with Scott and James Harkness. At the end of her year in Eu-
rope, Gentry returned to Bryn Mawr and its fellowship. Despite Scott’s urging her
to stay, Winston left because she could not aﬀord a year without ﬁnancial support.
Since her family was moving to Chicago, Winston applied for a fellowship at
the newly opened University of Chicago. Although she was awarded only an hon-
orary fellowship that paid her tuition, it was suﬃcient since she could live with
her parents. At Chicago, Winston took courses from E. H. Moore, Oskar Bolza,
and Heinrich Maschke. They encouraged her to stay at Chicago but she wanted
to study in Germany, and in the spring of 1893, with their recommendations, she
applied for the ACA European fellowship. She did not receive the fellowship, but in
late August 1893 she met with Felix Klein of G¨ottingen who was in Chicago as the
representative of German mathematics at the International Mathematical Congress
held in connection with the World’s Columbian Exposition. He encouraged her to
come to G¨ottingen to study, although he could not promise her admission there.
Christine Ladd Franklin, who had previously corresponded with Klein about the
admission of women to G¨ottingen, heard of Winston’s desire to study in Germany
and sent her $500 to help ﬁnance her ﬁrst year there. The following week Winston
received an oﬀer to teach at Vassar College, which she turned down.

At the end of September 1893 Mary Frances Winston sailed on the S. S. Wester-
land with Ida Hyde, the biologist who had received the ACA European fellowship.
Much of the information about Winston’s experiences in Europe comes from letters
to her family that were transcribed by her daughter, Caroline Beshers, who gave
copies of the transcriptions to one of the authors. The letters and transcriptions
are now in the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College.

By mid-October 1893 Winston had met with Klein, who told her to write a
petition for admission and informed her that she could attend lectures while waiting
for a response. She also met Grace Chisholm and Margaret Maltby, two women who
had also come to G¨ottingen to try to enroll: Chisholm in mathematics, Maltby in
physics. Upon ﬁrst meeting Chisholm, May Winston wrote to her brother Charley
October 17, 1893, “We are to have nearly the same work and I think we will work
together a good deal. It is an opportunity which I have never enjoyed before–to work
with someone who is my equal–or nearly so–for I do not consider her very much
ahead of me.” By December of that year Winston had realized that Chisholm’s
English mathematical education was more extensive than her own and realized
that she would not get her degree as quickly as Chisholm would.

By the end of October 1893, Winston, Chisholm, and Maltby were all informed
that their petitions had been accepted “ausnahm weise (as an exception).” That
same week, Winston attended her ﬁrst lectures: Klein’s on hypergeometric series
and Heinrich Weber’s on function theory and on theory of algebraic numbers. She
also expected to attend both Klein’s and Weber’s seminaries and expected to stop

attending one of Weber’s courses. On December 20, 1893, Winston became the ﬁrst
woman to give a Vortrag (read a paper) at the university at G¨ottingen when she
outlined a paper that had appeared in the Mathematische Annalen.

Winston remained in Europe, studying at G¨ottingen and occasionally traveling.
She and Chisholm were close friends and “they called one another Julius and Pom-
pey, [presumably] because they had crossed the Rhine to victory” (Caroline Beshers
to one of the authors, February 24, 1977). Winston decided against applying for
the ACA European fellowship for her second year since she had not done any orig-
inal research by the time the application was due. Her family supported her during
1894–95. Winston’s ﬁrst original work was done during the summer of 1894 and
appeared in the Mathematische Annalen in 1895. With that paper she was able
to secure the ACA fellowship for 1895–96, her third and ﬁnal year at G¨ottingen.
Her dissertation, written under Klein’s supervision, was completed by the middle
of that year, and she passed her examination in July 1896. Winston received her
PhD magna cum laude in 1897 after ﬁnally ﬁnding a publisher for her dissertation
in Germany. Chisholm and Maltby had both received their PhD’s in 1895, and so
Winston was the second woman, and the ﬁrst American woman, to receive a doc-
torate in mathematics from G¨ottingen as an enrolled student; Soﬁa Kovalevskaya
had received a PhD from G¨ottingen in 1874 but had never attended classes there.
While in G¨ottingen May Winston was part of an American community that
included many students of mathematics. She met and became friends with An-
nie MacKinnon (Fitch), who was the ACA European fellow for the year 1894–95.
Two other mathematicians who had been at Cornell University and were study-
ing at G¨ottingen during this time were Virgil Snyder, who received his PhD from
G¨ottingen in 1895, and J. H. Tanner. Both returned to Cornell and spent the re-
mainder of their careers there. In March 1897 Tanner wrote to the University of
Minnesota that Winston “impressed me as an unusually strong mathematician; I
should place her certainly in the ﬁrst group of half a dozen women mathematicians
in this century. Few of our people, whether men or women, have had so good a
training as has this young women, added to this she has an especially good mathe-
matical mind. She has thoroughly saturated herself with the spirit of modern ideas
in mathematics” (private collection).

Winston returned to the United States in 1896 without a job, but at the begin-
ning of September she found a position for the year 1896–97 teaching at St. Joseph
High School in St. Joseph, Missouri. In December 1896 she read a paper at a con-
ference held in Chicago; the conference, which had been called by local members
of the AMS, adopted a resolution that resulted in the formation of the Chicago
Section of the AMS. In 1897 Winston was appointed professor of mathematics at
Kansas State Agricultural College (now Kansas State University) in Manhattan.
Soon after her appointment, H. B. Newson of the mathematics department of the
University of Kansas wrote a review of her dissertation stating: “This publication
by Miss Winston . . . is in all respects worthy of that lady’s reputation as a math-
ematician. . . . Although this work was written before its author became a Kansan,
it reﬂects credit upon the state and the state institution which she represents”
(Kansas Univ. Quart. 7 (1898): 40).

Winston stayed at Kansas State for three years before resigning in order to
marry Henry Byron Newson on July 21, 1900. H. B. Newson was born July 10,
1860, in Mt. Gilead, Ohio, and was educated at Ohio Wesleyan University (which

later conferred an honorary doctorate on him) and at Johns Hopkins University. He
also studied in Heidelberg and with Sophus Lie 1887–88 in Leipzig. Newson taught
at Central Tennessee College 1884–86 and at Western Normal College in Bushell,
Illinois, 1888–90 before going to the University of Kansas in 1890. At the University
of Kansas, nepotism regulations prevented Mary Winston Newson from teaching
during the year, but she was able to teach during the summers. Also during this
period, with David Hilbert’s permission, she translated his famous “Mathematical
Problems” paper for the Bulletin of the AMS.

The Newsons had three children: Caroline (1901–1998), Josephine (1903–1994),
and Henry Winston (1909–1978). Her eldest daughter, Caroline Newson Beshers,
later reported in a letter to one of the authors that Henry B. Newson “was trying
very hard to encourage [May] to be a mathematician. May’s mother wrote her
urging that she set aside a few hours every day for study, as she herself had done,
and she also wrote Henry encouraging him to encourage [May]” (August 3, 1977).
In Lawrence, Mary W. Newson became friends with Helen Brewster (Owens), who
earned her master’s degree in 1901 under the supervision of H. B. Newson. In 1937
Owens organized a luncheon to honor women pioneers in mathematics, and Newson
was one of the honored guests.

On the night of February 17, 1910, Henry Byron Newson died in his sleep. Not
yet ﬁfty, he had been unable to purchase life insurance because of a bad heart
and had taught only nineteen and a half years of the twenty years required in
order for his widow to receive payments from his retirement pension. Thus, Mary
W. Newson was left with only the income from two houses they rented, an income
insuﬃcient to support her and her three children. Although the University of Kansas
mathematics department hired three new faculty members that year, including
Marion Ballantyne White, they could not have hired Newson because her sister
Alice Winston had just accepted a position in the English department. When the
1910 census was enumerated in April, Mary Newson, her three small children, and a
sister-in-law were listed together. Mary Newson’s recently widowed father, her late
mother’s sister, her sister Alice, and a housekeeper were also living in Lawrence; the
latter were still living there in January 1920. Newson remained in Lawrence for a
few years after her husband’s death. During that period she and Helen Owens, who
had returned from New York to Kansas to work on the 1911–12 suﬀrage campaign,
helped produce a Votes for Women Pageant there.

In 1913 Newson accepted a job as an assistant professor at Washburn College in
Topeka, Kansas, close enough so that she could come back to Lawrence to spend
weekends with her children, who were at ﬁrst living at her father’s house. In 1915
only the youngest child was enumerated with Mary Newson’s father, aunt, and sister
in Lawrence. While at Washburn, Newson joined the MAA as a charter member and
was one of the ﬁfteen original members of the Kansas Section. She often attended
the Kansas Section meetings, leading a discussion on a paper of J. N. Van der Vries
one year and presenting a paper of her own another year. She was also active in the
Kansas Association of Teachers of Mathematics, serving as its chairman in 1915.
She was an assistant professor when she left Washburn College at the end of the
1920–21 academic year.

In 1921 Newson became head of the department of mathematics at Eureka Col-
lege in Eureka, Illinois. During the spring of 1921 she had been looking actively

for a new position, applying at least to Eureka, the University of Texas, and Mon-
tana State. Her son later reported that she was oﬀered a position at Texas, but
that it was withdrawn because her brother was a professor of economics there. Her
daughter Caroline reported that she wanted to leave Washburn because she was
“dissatisﬁed with her subordinate position under a man with much less knowledge”
(letter to author February 24, 1977). In addition, Newson had signed a petition
supporting a faculty member, Dr. Kirkpatrick, who had been ﬁred for expressing
his political opinions to students. The incident was investigated by the AAUP at
the time. All those who signed the petition left Washburn within a few years.

Newson remained at Eureka the rest of her career. She taught courses in both
mathematics and astronomy and shared the leadership of a combined mathemat-
ics and science division from 1928 until 1934 when she became chairman of that
division. She was forced to retire from full-time teaching in 1937 when the college
instituted a mandatory retirement policy. She continued teaching part time and re-
mained chair of the division another two years. Newson ﬁnally retired from teaching
at the end of the 1941–42 academic year.

At Eureka, Newson was active in the Illinois Section of the MAA and was par-
ticularly active in the AAUW. She was instrumental in the founding of the local
chapter of AAUW and served as chairman of the International Relations Round
Table of the Eureka branch of the AAUW from 1928 until 1938. In 1940 Newson
was honored by the Women’s Centennial Congress as one of one hundred women
who held positions that were not open to them a hundred years earlier. Her daugh-
ter later reported that “it was characteristic of her that when a reporter called the
college no one there knew she had received the invitation. She had declined because
the dinner came on the same day as her ﬁrst classes of that semester” (letter to
author February 24, 1977). The local paper, The Daily Pantograph in Blooming-
ton, Illinois, quoted her as saying, “The trip is out. In my 33 years of teaching,
I’ve always opened my classes on the ﬁrst day. Any professor knows that he should
introduce his own work himself.” Instead the Eureka chapter of the AAUW and
the local international relations group, two groups with which Newson was involved
from the start, honored her with a dinner in April 1941.

In 1913 the University of Wisconsin elected Newson as an alumni member of Phi
Beta Kappa. She was a long-standing member of AAUW, having attended meetings
as early as her student days at the University of Chicago when it was still the ACA.
She was also a member of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, was raised a
Unitarian and kept that aﬃliation as an adult, and in 1914 reported that she was
a political independent.

After her retirement Newson moved to Lake Dalecarlia in Lowell, Indiana, where
she had previously spent vacations. In 1956 she moved to a nursing home in
Poolesville, Maryland, near where her daughter Caroline Beshers lived. She died
at the nursing home at age ninety and was buried in Lawrence, Kansas. In 1977
Caroline Beshers wrote that her “mother was probably the most modest and unas-
suming person alive” but that she had “had the energy and courage to face up to
Kaiser Wilhem II and to win, Magna cum Laude.”

After Newson’s death her children endowed a Mary Newson lecture series on
international relations at Eureka College. In March 2007 Newson was named one of
Eureka College’s “Matrons of Distinction”; in connection with that honor she was
described on the web page for March 3rd as “a champion of academic freedom, of
