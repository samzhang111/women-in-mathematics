BRADY, Dorothy (Stahl). June 14, 1903–April 17, 1977.
Reed College (BA 1924), Cornell University (MA 1926), University of Cali-
fornia (PhD 1933).

Dorothy Elizabeth Stahl was born in Elk River, Minnesota, the eldest of four
children of Agnes M. (Roche) and Henry V. Stahl, both born in 1875 in Wisconsin.
In 1900 Agnes Roche and Henry Stahl were both teachers and boarded at the
same address in Graceville, Minnesota. They married two years later. Their other
children were a daughter, Margaret, born in Elk River in about 1904, and two sons,
Donald and George, born in Wisconsin in about 1909 and 1910, respectively. In
1910 the family was living in Bayﬁeld, Wisconsin, where Henry Stahl was a high
school teacher. By 1920 they were living in Portland, Oregon, and Henry Stahl was
working as an insurance agent.

Dorothy Stahl attended Lincoln High School in Portland and studied mathemat-
ics and physics at Reed College, where she was a student assistant and from which
she graduated as a mathematics major in 1924. On June 14, 1924, in Portland, Ore-
gon, she married Robert Alexander Brady (1901–1963), who had graduated from
Reed College the previous year and remained at Reed as a teaching assistant in
history 1923–24. Robert Brady, born in Marysville, Washington, worked as a prin-
cipal of a high school in Florence, Oregon, 1924–25, studied at Cornell 1925–26,
worked in the New York City area 1926–29, and received a PhD in economics from
Columbia University in 1929. In 1929 he joined the University of California faculty.
Dorothy Brady attended graduate school at Cornell 1925–26. She received her
master’s degree in mathematics in 1926 with major subject mathematical analysis
and minor subject geometry; her examination committee was chaired by W. A.
Hurwitz. Brady was instructor of mathematics the following year, 1926–27, at Vas-
sar College. In 1927 she worked at the National Bureau of Economic Research as a
research assistant on a study of labor statistics before studying and teaching math-
ematics and economic statistics at New York University 1927–29; Robert Brady
also taught at NYU during those two years. Dorothy Brady continued her study
of mathematics at the University of Berlin in Germany during the winter of 1930–
31 when Robert Brady had a research fellowship to study the “rationalization” of
industry in Germany. She then attended the University of California 1931–33 and
received a PhD in mathematics in 1933. The Bradys’ son, M. Michael, was born in
December 1933. They later divorced, and Robert Brady remarried in April 1936.
Their son earned a master’s degree from MIT in 1958 and was awarded a Fulbright
fellowship to study electrical engineering in Oslo for the following year. He is an
engineer living in Oslo and writes about Nordic skiing and living abroad.

In 1936 Dorothy S. Brady began a long career as an economist and statistician
working for the federal government and in academic institutions. She worked ﬁrst
for the government in Washington, D.C., for a dozen years. From 1936 to 1943
she worked for the US Department of Agriculture. She worked in the area of fam-
ily expenditures for the Bureau of Home Economics (renamed Bureau of Human
Nutrition and Home Economics in February 1953). She was an associate econo-
mist 1936–38, home economics specialist 1938–42, and senior statistician 1942–43.
During the years 1937–39 she also studied statistics at the US Department of Agri-
culture Graduate School.

In 1943 she moved to the US Department of Labor, where she held positions
within the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 1943–44 she was chief of the family ex-
penditure section within the cost of living division and served as assistant chief
of the division. From 1944 to 1948 she was chief of the cost of living division and
was responsible for the analytical procedures used in the consumer price index, the
derivation and pricing of the city worker’s family budget, and economic analysis of
family expenditure data. During this period she wrote articles, some of which ap-
peared without attribution, for the Monthly Labor Review of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. She was a lecturer for a graduate course at American University in the
spring of 1946.

In 1948 Brady assumed positions at the University of Illinois. She was appointed
professor of economics to serve half time to teach quantitative economics in the De-
partment of Economics. She was also research professor of economics half time and
conducted research in the ﬁeld of consumer economics in the Bureau of Economic
and Business Research in the College of Commerce. Seven letters of recommenda-
tion for Brady for these positions from persons she had worked with in academic
and government settings are uniformly enthusiastic. A letter of February 13, 1948,
from Milton Friedman, later to win the Nobel Prize in economics, begins, “I ﬁnd it
diﬃcult to use anything except superlatives in describing Dorothy Brady’s qualiﬁ-
cations for a teaching and research position” (Staﬀ Appointments File for Dorothy
Stahl Brady, University Archives, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign).

In 1951, while at Illinois, Brady also became a consultant on costs and standards
of living for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Because of these research commitments,
she requested and was granted a leave of absence without pay from her Illinois
positions for most of second semester 1950–51. Because of her commitment to help
with the revision of the consumer price index, she then resigned those positions
eﬀective August 31, 1951, in order to return to full-time government service in
Washington. In her role as the consultant on costs and standards of living for
the Department of Labor, Brady spoke at an equal pay conference called by the
department’s Women’s Bureau in March 1952. She noted a dramatic decrease over
ten years in the ratio of women’s to men’s earnings, “from 59 to 45 per cent”
(“Crusade advocated to force equal pay,” New York Times, 1 Apr 1952).

In 1953 Brady was chief of the division of prices and cost of living and was
responsible for price indexes, consumer expenditure surveys, and other cost of living
surveys. During the early 1950s she presented several papers at the Conference on
Research in Income and Wealth of the National Bureau of Economic Research; she
served on the executive committee of the conference and chaired the committee in
1953–54.

In 1956 she resumed her work in an academic setting when she joined the faculty
at the University of Chicago as professor of economics. Two years later, in 1958, she
moved to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, also as professor
of economics, and remained until her retirement a dozen years later. For the period
1956 to 1960, she was again a consultant to the Bureau of Labor Statistics on prices
and cost of living. From 1964 to 1971 she was a consultant to the Social Security
Administration, Oﬃce of Research and Statistics, working mainly on a project on
age and income distribution and on plans for a retirement history study. She served
as book review editor of the Journal of Economic History 1969–74. Brady retired
from the Wharton School in 1970 as professor emeritus but was a consultant there

until 1974. While at Wharton, she was research professor of economics and for the
period 1964–70 was chairman of the graduate group in economic history.

In 1948 Brady received the National Women’s Press Club Award in Economics
for her work in developing the city worker’s family budget. In 1950 she was made a
fellow of the American Statistical Association and the following year she was made
a fellow of the Econometric Society. Richard Easterlin, her colleague and friend at
the Wharton School, describes some of her personal qualities in his article in the
Journal of Economic History after her death. “She was sensitive, considerate, and
utterly without pretense. I never knew a person less given to small talk; yet she
was always interesting and fun to be with.”

Dorothy Brady suﬀered from a heart ailment and died in 1977 at the home she
shared with her friend and fellow economist, Eleanor M. Snyder, in Pine Hill, New
York. Brady was seventy-three at the time of her death. She was survived by her
son, Michael Brady, of Oslo, Norway, and her sister. There was no funeral and her
body was donated to science.
