SMITH, Clara E. May 20, 1865–May 12, 1943.
Mount Holyoke College (BA 1902), Yale University (PhD 1904).

Clara Eliza Smith was born in Northford, Connecticut, the only child of Geor-
giana (Smith) (b. 1834) and Edward Smith (1832–1894), a farmer and cabinet maker
in Northford. She was educated with private tutors and entered Mount Holyoke Fe-
male Seminary in 1882. She graduated in 1885, four years before the ﬁrst bachelor’s
degree was awarded by Mount Holyoke and eight years before its present name was
adopted. Letters from this period of her life have been deposited in the Mount
Holyoke College library.

Smith attended the Yale School of the Fine Arts 1886–87 and 1888–89 after
which she was a teacher of drawing and assistant in mathematics at the Blooms-
burg Literary Institute and State Normal School (now Bloomsburg University of
Pennsylvania) for eight years, 1889–97.

Smith entered the Yale graduate school in 1901 to study mathematics. At that
point she had taken plane and solid geometry and plane and spherical trigonometry
as requirements for her graduation from Mount Holyoke Seminary. She also studied
higher algebra, analytic geometry, and calculus on her own. Smith was awarded a
bachelor’s degree from Mount Holyoke College in 1902 after passing an exam on
one year’s additional work in French and on the presentation of a certiﬁcate from
Yale for courses in mathematics. Her graduate work at Yale in 1901–02 was in
vector analysis with J. W. Gibbs, diﬀerential equations and function theory with J.
P. Pierpont, diﬀerential geometry with W. A. Granville, and projective geometry
with E. B. Wilson. The next year she had theory of functions of a complex variable
with Pierpont, advanced analytic geometry with P. F. Smith, higher algebra with H.
E. Hawkes, partial diﬀerential equations with E. R. Hedrick, and transformations of
space with A. G. Gale. In 1903–04 she took theory of functions of a real variable with
Pierpont, continuous groups with Smith, and elliptic functions with Hawkes. Clara
Smith wrote her dissertation under the direction of James Pierpont, a native of
New Haven, who had gone to Yale after several years of study in Europe, especially
in Berlin and in Vienna, where he received his PhD in 1894.

Clara Smith received her PhD in 1904 and remained at Yale as a reader in
mathematics for two years, after which she was an acting instructor at Wellesley
College 1906–07. The following year she was an instructor at The Western College
for Women in Oxford, Ohio. In 1908 she returned to Wellesley as assistant and,
except for leaves, spent the rest of her career there. She was an instructor 1909–
14, associate professor 1914–24, professor 1924–34, (some years as the Helen Day
Gould Professor), and emeritus professor after her retirement in 1934. She had three
leaves of absence: in 1911–12, during which she traveled, attended the September
1911 meeting of the German mathematical society, and studied one semester at
the university in G¨ottingen; in 1918–19, when she was an exchange professor at
Goucher College; and in 1926–27, when she made a trip around the world.

While at Wellesley, Smith coauthored two books with Helen A. Merrill; the ﬁrst
was “prepared for use in a required ﬁrst-year course in Wellesley College” (p. iii) and
was printed in 1914, and the second was published in 1917. Merrill was a long-time
Wellesley faculty member who had earned her PhD from Yale a year before Smith,
and who chaired the mathematics department from 1916 until her retirement in

1932. Smith was department chair for the following two years, 1932–34, before her
own retirement.

Clara Smith served in a number of ways on the College Entrance Examination
Board: as a reader starting in 1919, on a committee on revision, and on a board
of examiners. She became a life member of the AMS, was permanent secretary of
the membership committee during the 1920s, and was a trustee on the original
board of the AMS in 1927, a thirty-one member body formed at the time of its
incorporation. Smith and Anna J. Pell (Wheeler) of Bryn Mawr College were the
only women on the board. Smith was a charter member of the MAA, served as
a trustee 1923–25, and was vice president 1927. In a resolution voted on by the
board of trustees at the annual meeting of the MAA, December 31, 1924–January
1, 1925, she was singled out for the eﬀorts she made while she was in charge of
a joint committee on membership of the AMS and the MAA. Her work for the
AMS was also recognized in a resolution of the council in September 1925 and
in one of several “resolutions on deaths of persons who have been prominent in
the work of the Society” (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 49:827). That resolution read in
part, “Much of the success of [the membership committee] was due to her laborious
and painstaking assembling of data regarding teachers of college mathematics. On
behalf of the Society, the Council wishes to acknowledge her loving interest in its
welfare” (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 49:828).

Smith was a member of the Congregational Church. In 1923 she described her
hobbies as “tramping and outdoor sports.” In July 1927, she was severely injured
in an automobile accident. A news item from February 21, 1935, noted that Lennie
Phoebe Copeland and Clara Eliza Smith, retired head of the mathematics depart-
ment, “sailed last week from New York for travel in the near east including Egypt,
Palestine, Syria, Uganda, Turkey, Greece, and Italy” (Lennie P. Copeland folder,
Wellesley College Archives). They were due back in June. Smith and Copeland, her
long-time friend and colleague in the mathematics department, shared a home in
Wellesley from the early 1920s. In her response to a request for information from
Helen Owens in 1937, Copeland noted that she would be spending the summer “on
Miss Smith’s farm in the hills of Connecticut.” They both attended the Septem-
ber 1937 AMS meeting in State College, Pennsylvania, where Smith was one of
three guests of honor at a luncheon organized by Owens that was “held in honor of
the women who were pioneers in mathematical research in America” (Bull. Amer.
Math. Soc. 43:747).

In May 1943, shortly before her seventy-eighth birthday, Clara Eliza Smith died
of a cerebral hemorrhage at her home in Wellesley. She is buried at the Northford
Cemetery in Connecticut. She had no immediate survivors.
