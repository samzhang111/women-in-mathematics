COHEN, Teresa. February 14, 1892–August 10, 1992.
Goucher College (BA 1912), Johns Hopkins University (MA 1915, PhD 1918).

Teresa Cohen was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the daughter of Rebecca (Sin-
sheimer) (b. 1856) and Benjamin Cohen (b. 1855), natives of Maryland. She was
the eldest of four children; her younger siblings were Simon (1894–1977), Martha
(1896–1978), and Hilda (1898–2000). Her father was a wholesale shoe merchant.

Cohen graduated from Friends School in Baltimore in 1909 before entering
Goucher College from which she graduated in 1912 as a member of Phi Beta Kappa.
Her two sisters also graduated from Goucher; Martha became a social worker, and
Hilda became an attorney. Her brother, Simon, studied at the Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity and received his bachelor’s degree from the University of Cincinnati. He then
was ordained a rabbi by, and later received a Doctor of Divinity degree from, He-
brew Union College in Cincinnati; he spent most of his career engaged in academic
work.

In 1912 Teresa Cohen entered Johns Hopkins with a resident fellowship for the
year 1912–13. After she received her master’s degree in 1915, she was made a
university scholar at Johns Hopkins for the year 1915–16 and was a fellow 1917–18.
In her dissertation she thanks not only her advisor, Frank Morley, but also A. B.
Coble, Abraham Cohen, and two of her teachers at Goucher, Clara L. Bacon and
Florence P. Lewis. Her minor subjects were physical chemistry and chemistry.

After receiving her PhD in 1918, Cohen went to the University of Illinois for the
year 1918–19 as an instructor. She also taught courses at Johns Hopkins during
the summers of 1918, 1919, and 1920. In the fall of 1920, the chairman of Pennsyl-
vania State College (now University) found himself in need of another instructor
and remembered that Abraham Cohen, Teresa Cohen’s uncle and one of his for-
mer teachers at Johns Hopkins, had mentioned that his niece was available for
employment. Thus, in September 1920 Teresa Cohen became the ﬁrst woman on
the mathematics faculty at Penn State. She said in a 1979 interview, “I used to
stay out of the way and hope that if I wasn’t a nuisance they’d get some more
women” (Hale). Over the years a number of women joined Cohen and stayed at
Penn State; these include Aline Huke Frink, Beatrice Hagen, and Helen Owens. In
the late 1930s, Owens, who was not yet on the faculty because she was the wife of the
chairman of the department, formed the Committee for Study of Women’s Work
in Mathematics, for which Cohen served as chairman. That committee arranged
a luncheon honoring early American women mathematicians at the mathematics
meetings held in State College in September 1937. Also at those meetings, Cohen
performed a violin sonatina at a concert held one evening.

Cohen remained on the faculty of Penn State until she was forced to retire at age
seventy. She was promoted to assistant professor in 1921, to associate professor in
1938, and to professor in 1945. In 1956 the department published notes on “Basic
Algebra and Trigonometry” that she had written with two colleagues, Walter J.
Harrington and Frank Kocher.

After her retirement, Cohen held the title professor emeritus, taught some classes,
and worked as an unpaid volunteer, tutoring students who had problems with math-
ematics. She continued to tutor on a regular basis for twenty-four years until a
serious accident in early 1986 prevented her from doing so. A car lost its brakes
and pinned her against her house causing her severe damage from which she never

completely recovered. After several months in the hospital and in rehabilitation
in Pennsylvania, her family moved her to a nursing home in Pikesville, Maryland,
where she lived until her ﬁnal illness.

Both before and after the accident, Cohen was recognized for her contributions
to Penn State and its mathematics department. In November 1979, the alumni
association of the Lion’s Paw Senior Honor Society, a group that recognizes student
leaders at Penn State, presented Cohen with its Lion’s Paw Medal for extraordinary
service to the university. In 1982 the department created the Teresa Cohen Service
Award, which is presented biannually on, or close to, Cohen’s Valentine’s Day
birthdate; the award is given to one faculty member at the main campus and another
at one of the other campuses in the university system. After Cohen’s accident, her
niece and nephew contributed to the establishment in 1987 of the Teresa Cohen
Tutorial Endowment Fund in the mathematics department. In 1991, a year before
Cohen’s death, the department established the Sperling-Cohen tutoring program
for ﬁrst-year calculus that bears her name along with that of a 1936 alumnus who
contributed generously to the department’s tutoring program. The head of the
department in 1992, Jerry Bona, said “One of her greatest gifts to us was that she
showed us what to do and how to do it. We are merely following her example”
(Ferguson 1992).

Cohen was active in Sigma Delta Epsilon (now Sigma Delta Epsilon/Graduate
Women in Science) and was national treasurer from 1954 until 1963, a year after her
retirement from teaching. At the time of her retirement, the Sigma Delta Epsilon
News reported that “one of her great loves is music and she goes to as many
concerts as she can. She plays the violin and continues to take lessons during summer
vacations. She says, ‘I am not much of a player, but I do have a lot of fun.’ ” She
started her violin lessons at age ten and continued them until age eighty-ﬁve. She
spent her summers at a home in the Baltimore area that she maintained at least
through 1979, when she remarked that “Pennsylvania is like a family you’re married
into but Maryland is kinfolks” (Hale).

Teresa Cohen died of pneumonia at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, in
1992, almost six months after celebrating her one hundredth birthday. She is buried
at the Oheb Shalom Cemetery in Baltimore. She was survived by her youngest
sister, a nephew and two nieces, as well as grandnieces, grandnephews, great-
grandnieces, and great-grandnephews.
