BARTON, Helen. August 9, 1891–March 19, 1971.
Goucher College (BA 1913), Johns Hopkins University (MA 1922, PhD 1926).

Martha Helen Barton was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the daughter of Mary
Irene (Eichelberger) (b. 1860) and James Sheridan Barton (b. 1858), both Maryland
natives. She had an older brother, Alan Eichelberger (1889–1964), and a younger
sister, Vola Price (1893–1982), also born in Maryland, presumably in Baltimore,
where her family made its home. In 1900 her parents had been married eleven years.
At that time her father’s occupation was listed as groceryman; in 1910 he was a
coal merchant and in 1920 a retail merchant, general store. Her brother became a
contractor in Baltimore, and her sister became a college physics professor.

Helen Barton received her primary and secondary education in the public schools
of Baltimore and graduated with honors from Western High School. She attended
Goucher College (Woman’s College of Baltimore until 1910) as a Western High
School alumnae scholar 1909–11 and graduated in 1913, a member of Phi Beta
Kappa. While Barton was a student at Goucher, two faculty members there were
awarded PhD’s in mathematics at Johns Hopkins; they were Clara L. Bacon in 1911
and Florence P. Lewis in 1913. Barton mentioned in a letter of Sept 22, 1937, to
Helen Owens that Clara Bacon ”was my beloved teacher at Goucher and has been a
real friend through these many years.” The year after her graduation Barton served
as an assistant in physics at Goucher and the following year, 1914–15, did graduate
work in mathematics and physics as a Goucher alumnae fellow at the Johns Hopkins
University. In 1915 her sister, Vola Price Barton, graduated from Goucher with a
major in mathematics, also as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Vola Barton earned
a master’s degree from Mount Holyoke College in 1917 and immediately was hired
at Goucher; she earned a PhD in physics from Johns Hopkins in 1923 and served
as professor of physics and department chairman at Goucher before her retirement
in 1958.

From 1915 until 1919 Helen Barton served as head of the department of chemistry
and physics at Salem College, a private college for women in Winston-Salem, North
Carolina. The following two years she was an instructor in mathematics at Wellesley
College. She continued her graduate work at Johns Hopkins during the summers
of 1920 and 1921 and did some graduate work at Harvard University during the
winter of 1921 while also teaching at Wellesley. She received the master’s degree in
June 1922 from Johns Hopkins.

Barton left her position at Wellesley in 1921 and moved to Albion College in
Michigan, where she was associate professor of mathematics and dean of women
1921–25. In 1925 she resumed her full-time graduate work at Johns Hopkins and
was a university scholar for the year 1925–26. Her language requirements in French
and German were approved in October 1925; and she passed written and oral exam-
inations in mathematics as principal subject, physics as ﬁrst subordinate subject,
and applied mathematics as second subordinate subject in May 1926. In a letter
of May 13, 1926, recommending the acceptance of her dissertation, Frank Morley
and Francis D. Murnaghan wrote that she “has considerably simpliﬁed the exposi-
tion of Grassmann’s theory of extensive magnitudes by the use of [the generalized
Kronecker symbol]” (Ferdinand Hamburger Archives of The Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity, RG 13.010, Oﬃce of the Registrar, Subgroup 1, Series 2, [Barton, Helen]).

The doctorate was awarded in June 1926. Barton spent the following year as pro-
fessor and head of the department at Alabama College, then a college for women
in Montevallo, Alabama; it is now the coeducational University of Montevallo.

In 1927 Helen Barton joined the faculty of the North Carolina College for Women
(later Woman’s College of the University of North Carolina and now the University
of North Carolina at Greensboro), where she was to remain until her retirement.
She began her career there as associate professor and acting head of the department,
and the following year, 1928, became professor and head of the department. She
retired as professor emeritus at age sixty-eight in 1960 but continued teaching part
time.

In addition to teaching and chairing the mathematics department, Barton was
active both on campus and in various professional groups. She was president of the
faculty science club at Woman’s College 1929–30 and was president of the campus
chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. Later in her career Barton was chairman of the faculty
planning committee for the new McIver classroom building, and the faculty lounge
in McIver was named in her honor in 1960. Barton was on the accrediting committee
of AAUW and was a member of the North Carolina Education Association, serving
as president of the mathematics section 1933–34. She was also an active member
of the North Carolina Academy of Science and was vice president 1933–34; she was
president 1928–29 and secretary 1931–32 of the mathematics section; and she was
elected a life member of the Academy in 1961.

At one point after her most active period in professional organizations but before
her retirement, Barton described her hobbies as “travel when I can ﬁnd time and
money at the same time” (University of North Carolina at Greensboro Archives).
Her travel included a trip in the summer of 1958 to the Canadian Rockies, Glacier
National Park, Lake Louise, Banﬀ, and Jasper National Park. She was a member
of a Methodist church in Baltimore but attended the Presbyterian Church of the
Covenant in Greensboro.

Helen Barton died at the Greensboro Convalescent Center at age seventy-nine
after a long illness and was buried in Baltimore, where her surviving sibling, Vola P.
Barton, still lived. Helen Barton left $5000 to the University of North Carolina at
Greensboro to establish the Helen Barton Mathematics Scholarship Fund. A second
bequest of $500 was made to the Helen Barton Professorship Fund, which was
established in 1962 and helps support the Helen Barton Excellence Professorship.
