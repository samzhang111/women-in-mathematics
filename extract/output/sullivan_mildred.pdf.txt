SULLIVAN, Mildred M. November 16, 1907–August 30, 1958.
Radcliffe College (BA 1929, MA 1930, PhD 1932).

Mildred Marie Sullivan was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the youngest of two surviv-
ing children of three born to Alice T. (Sullivan) (b. 1875) and John F. Sullivan (b. 1871),
both born in Massachusetts of Irish parents. In 1900 her parents had been married six
years, and there was one living child, John F. Jr. (b. 1895), of two that had been born.
Her father was a letter carrier for the post oﬃce.

Sullivan did her undergraduate and graduate work at Radcliﬀe College and earned her
doctorate at the age of twenty-four. Her dissertation in potential theory was supervised
by O. D. Kellogg. In Kellogg’s November 1931 application for funds for a book project,
he wrote, “the assistant is available in Miss Mildred M. Sullivan, now a graduate student
at Radcliﬀe and a candidate for the doctorate in June of the present year. She has un-
usual originality and power to carry through, with a minimum of guidance, on assigned
programs. Her availability appears to present a rare opportunity for help on the above
project” (Papers of William Fogg Osgood, HUG 4659.10, Harvard University Archives).
Sullivan planned to work as Kellogg’s research assistant the year after she received her
doctorate in June. However, Kellogg died suddenly in July 1932. Sullivan was a research
assistant in mathematics at Harvard under a Milton Fund grant in 1932–33. During that
year she presented their joint work at an AMS meeting and wrote a paper based on that
work that was published in 1935 under her name and Kellogg’s in the Memoirs of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

The year following her postdoctoral year at Harvard, Sullivan was a National Research
Fellow working at Rice Institute in Houston and at the University of California. She was
an instructor at the University of Houston 1934–35, during its ﬁrst year as a four-year
institution. This was during the Great Depression, and there is no indication that Sullivan
was able to secure academic employment at the end of that year. In January 1937 Sullivan
became an editorial assistant for the AMS in order to succeed Alta Odoms (Gray), who
had already resigned eﬀective April 1, 1937. In 1938 Sullivan became an instructor at
Queens College in Flushing, New York. She was an instructor until 1946, when she was
promoted to assistant professor. The year after her promotion Sullivan joined the MAA
and from then on regularly attended meetings of the Metropolitan New York Section. Also
starting when she became editorial assistant at the AMS in 1937, and continuing through
the 1940s, Sullivan attended several meetings a year of the society in the New York City
area.

Mildred Sullivan died suddenly in August 1958 of heart failure at age ﬁfty while visiting
relatives at her family’s home in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts.
She is buried in Holyhood Cemetery in Brookline.
