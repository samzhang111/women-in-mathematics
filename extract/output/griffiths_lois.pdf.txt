GRIFFITHS, Lois W. June 27, 1899–November 9, 1981.
University of Washington (BS 1921, MS 1923), University of Chicago (PhD
1927).

Lois Wilfred Griﬃths was born in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, the second of two children
of Lena (Jones) (1872–1956) and Frederick William Griﬃths (1867–1932). Some
sources give her mother’s birthplace as Iowa and others as Kansas. Her mother
graduated from the elementary course at the Kansas State Normal School in Em-
poria (now Emporia State University) in 1894 and taught school at various times;
in 1894 her home address was given as Lehigh, Indian Territory (now Oklahoma).
F. W. Griﬃths was born in Wales, immigrated to the United States in 1880, did
his precollege schooling in New York State, and received a BA degree from Oberlin
College in 1893. He earned a BD degree from Oberlin Theological Seminary in 1896
and was ordained a Congregational minister before marrying Lena Jones on Decem-
ber 31, 1896, in Ardmore, Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). F. W. Griﬃths was a
minister in Michigan 1896–97, in Ohio 1898–99, and in Jennings, Oklahoma Terri-
tory, 1899–1900 before traveling for the Minneapolis Journal 1900–04. The family
moved to Seattle in 1904, and F. W. Griﬃths was a pastor for a few years, was
vice president of a title guaranty and abstract company 1908–10, and was princi-
pal and then superintendent of schools outside of Seattle until 1919. He was senior
clerk in the accounting department of a railroad company in Seattle from 1920
until his death a dozen years later. Lois Griﬃths’ older brother, Harold Frederick,
was born in 1898, also in Ohio, and after studying three years at the University of
Washington, served in the Navy and later went into business in Seattle.

Lois Griﬃths received her elementary and secondary education in the public
schools in the state of Washington before entering the University of Washington.
Some of the time she was at Washington, she served as assistant to the comptroller
of the university. Among her professors was E. T. Bell. She received her bachelor’s
degree in 1921 and her master’s degree two years later.

Griﬃths entered the University of Chicago in October 1925 and attended for
seven quarters. She completed her dissertation under the direction of L. E. Dickson
and in her dissertation vita thanked Professors E. H. Moore, Bell, G. A. Bliss, and
Dickson for their guidance and inspiration.

After receiving her doctorate in 1927, Griﬃths was immediately hired by North-
western University in Evanston, Illinois, for what was to be her only teaching po-
sition. She was instructor 1927–30, assistant professor 1930–38, associate professor
1938–64, and emeritus associate professor after her retirement in 1964. Her promo-
tion to associate professor came after she had spent part of her 1936–37 sabbatical in
Cambridge, England. In 1947 Griﬃths published a textbook that was an expansion
of typewritten notes she had copyrighted in 1945 as “Determinants and Systems of
Linear Equations” and in 1946 as “Introduction to the Theory of Equations.” In
the late 1940s she produced two additional sets of notes, “Outline of the Theory
of Groups” (c1948) and “Matrices and Linear Dependence” (c1949), but did not
publish either of them.

Griﬃths published a dozen research articles over a twenty-one year period. These
articles appeared in the American Journal of Mathematics, the Annals of Mathe-
matics, and the Bulletin of the AMS. In 1942 she published an expository article in
the American Mathematical Monthly on representing numbers as sums of polygonal

numbers; between 1930 and 1945, seven of her eight research papers were concerned
with polygonal numbers. The eighth, “On hypergroups, multigroups, and product
systems,” appeared in 1938 and was referenced by other authors at least through
1986. From 1939 through the early 1940s, Griﬃths also reviewed textbooks for the
National Mathematics Magazine and regularly served as a referee for the Bulletin
of the AMS in the early 1930s and for the Monthly through most of the 1940s.

At various times Griﬃths spoke to both the junior and the senior mathematics
clubs at the University of Chicago, to the Northwestern mathematics club, and
to the Women’s Mathematics Club of Chicago. She was a charter member of the
Northwestern chapter of Sigma Delta Epsilon. In 1952 she was given an honorary
life membership in the Northwestern University Alumni Association. Her papers at
Northwestern University include teaching ﬁles, material related to her publications,
and mathematical correspondence, particularly with E. T. Bell in the 1940s. She
also maintained a close relationship with the University of Chicago and attended
seminars and meetings of the senior mathematics club there.

Griﬃths and her mother made a trip to Europe in 1935 and returned to the
United States in September of that year. Her mother came to live with her in the
mid-1940s and remained until her mother’s death in Evanston in 1956. In about
1940, Griﬃths indicated that her favorite recreation was walking. Acquaintances
of Griﬃths told one of the authors that she loved to garden and to cook and liked
classical music and kept notes on what she listened to on the radio.

Lois Griﬃths remained in Evanston after her retirement and died in nearby
Skokie in 1981 as a result of heart disease; she was eighty-two years old at the time
of her death in the Old Orchard Manor Nursing Home. She bequeathed her house
to the University of Chicago and had provided that her body be used for scientiﬁc
study after her death.
