ANDREWS, Grace. May 30, 1869–July 27, 1951.
Wellesley College (BS 1890), Columbia University (MA 1899, PhD 1901).

Grace Andrews was born in Brooklyn, New York, one of ﬁve children (four
daughters and a son) of Susan Matthews (Hotchkiss) (b. ca. 1827–1915), of Con-
necticut, and Edward Gayer Andrews (1825–1907), born in New York State. Her
father had studied at Cazenovia Seminary, graduated from Wesleyan University in
1847, and was serving as pastor of a church in Cooperstown at the time of her par-
ents’ marriage in 1851. Later he was brieﬂy president of Mansﬁeld Female College
in Ohio, was principal of Cazenovia Seminary, and in 1872 became a bishop of the
Methodist Episcopal Church. The three surviving siblings of Grace were Winifred
(b. ca. 1856), born in Ohio, and Helen (b. ca. 1859) and Edward (b. ca. 1863),
both born in New York. From 1872 to 1880 the family was living in Des Moines,
Iowa, and from 1880 to 1888 they were in Washington, D.C. In connection with her
father’s extended trip to India, Grace, her brother, and her mother spent about six
months in Europe in 1877.

Grace Andrews was educated at the Mount Vernon Seminary (later a college for
women and now a women’s campus of George Washington University) in Wash-
ington, D.C., before going to Wellesley College. She entered Wellesley in 1885 as
a member of the class of 1889 and, having taken the ﬁve-year course with music,
graduated in 1890. While at Wellesley she was a member of Zeta Alpha, a literary
and theatrical society on campus. She began graduate work at Columbia Univer-
sity in October 1897 and earned a master’s degree in 1899 and a PhD in 1901.
No advisor is indicated in the records. From 1900 to 1902 Andrews served as an
assistant in mathematics at Barnard College. She reported to Wellesley that during
the ﬁrst year she was teaching two classes, one freshman level and one elective, and
had light duties the second year. She was living in Manhattan when she joined the
AMS in December 1901 and remained at the same address through at least 1903,
after which she moved to her family’s home in Brooklyn. She continued to live with
her mother after her father’s death in 1907 and remained in the family home until
her mother’s death in 1915.

From 1905 to 1926 Grace Andrews was an accountant to the treasurer at Wes-
leyan University, work she was able to do while living in Brooklyn. She noted in
1909 that she was going to be taking a course in accounting. From 1916 until her
death she had responsible positions with the New York branch of the Women’s
Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, serving at various
times as home base secretary, receiving treasurer, treasurer, chairman of the ﬁnance
committee, and director.

Although she was not employed as a mathematician after 1902, Grace Andrews
attended about two AMS meetings a year in New York City through 1907 and
remained a member of the society until about 1918. Andrews was a member of
the Brooklyn Botanic Garden; the New York Wellesley Club; the Kosmos Club of
Brooklyn, where she was treasurer and director; and the Women’s University Club
of New York. She liked to travel and spent about a month every summer out of the
city, frequently in the nearby mountains. She was an avid reader and fond of doing
double crostic puzzles. Although she lived alone after the death of her mother, she
had many nieces and nephews in the vicinity and was involved with her extended
family.
