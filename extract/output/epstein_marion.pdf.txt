EPSTEIN, Marion (Greenebaum). June 14, 1915–.
Barnard College (BA 1935), Bryn Mawr College (MA 1936, PhD 1938).

Marion Belle Greenebaum is the third of three daughters of Anna (Rheinhold)
(1876–1927), born in Germany, and Milton Greenebaum (1876–1976), born in Bal-
timore, Maryland. Her mother, who attended the Normal College of the City of
New York (now Hunter College), was a teacher; her father, who attended the New
York City public schools and was self-educated, was an importer and exporter. Her
parents married in October 1907. Their three daughters were born in Brooklyn, and
all later earned bachelor’s degrees from Barnard College. Marion Greenebaum’s sis-
ters, Celine (1910–2003) and Helen (b. 1912), both did graduate studies in social
work and became licensed social workers.

Marion Greenebaum attended Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn 1927–31
and was awarded the Julia M. Dennis memorial scholarship at the time of her
graduation. She was also recognized as one of two obtaining the highest average in
mathematics in a graduating class of more than ﬁve hundred. She entered Barnard
College at age sixteen and graduated four years later with a major in mathematics.
Athletics were among her activities at Barnard, and in the spring of her senior year
she received a senior service award and numerals in basketball and tenikoit (also
known as ring tennis) from the Barnard College Athletic Association. She was later
the fund chair for her class.

After receiving her bachelor’s degree in 1935, Greenebaum immediately began
her graduate work in mathematics at Bryn Mawr College; she earned her master’s
degree a year later and her doctorate two years after that, at age twenty-three. She
held a graduate scholarship in mathematics 1935–37 and a resident fellowship in
mathematics 1937–38. Having become interested in abstract algebra when Nathan
Jacobson was at Bryn Mawr her ﬁrst year and ﬁnding no one on the faculty in that
area at Bryn Mawr, she wrote her dissertation in algebraic number theory under
the direction of H. W. Brinkmann of nearby Swarthmore College.

Greenebaum’s ﬁrst position was as a research statistician with the International
Statistical Bureau in New York City, where she worked from June 1938 until June
1939 doing economic statistical research for $25 a week. On June 25, 1939, she mar-
ried Jess Epstein, a research engineer who worked for RCA Manufacturing Company
in New Jersey. Epstein, born in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1907, received a bachelor’s de-
gree in 1932 and a master’s degree in 1934 from the University of Cincinnati after
working as a co-op engineer for the Crosley Radio Corporation in Ohio 1926–31.
He was an instructor of physics at the Cincinnati College of Pharmacy for one
year before moving to his position with RCA in New Jersey in 1935. Jess Epstein
remained with the RCA Manufacturing Company as research engineer until 1942,
when RCA Laboratories opened in Princeton, New Jersey. He then worked at RCA
Laboratories as research engineer 1942–62, as technical administrator of the Mis-
sile and Surface Radar Division 1962–67, and as staﬀ engineer from 1967 until his
retirement in 1973.

In May 1940 Marion Epstein wrote to Helen Owens that “unfortunately circum-
stances have kept me out of the academic ﬁeld and I have turned my activities more
toward the ﬁeld of statistics and economic research” (Owens Papers). In her 1940
questionnaire she reported that she was engaged in some volunteer social service

work and some independent research. The ﬁrst of the Epsteins’ three children, Pe-
ter, was born on May 24, 1941, in Moorestown, New Jersey. Their two daughters,
Barbara and Judith, were born in Princeton on December 16, 1943, and on January
7, 1948, respectively. All of the children earned master’s degrees, married, and are
or have been working in urban planning, education-related jobs, and therapy and
counseling.

In 1944 Marion G. Epstein returned to work part time with the Educational
Testing Service (ETS) in Princeton, New Jersey, where she remained, with some
breaks, for the rest of her career. She worked in the Test Development Division
until 1973. From 1944 to 1948, when her ﬁrst two children were young, she worked
as an associate examiner in mathematics about three hours a day, mainly on actu-
arial exams. When her youngest daughter was born in 1948, she stopped working at
ETS for a time. In 1954, when her daughter entered school, she resumed part-time
work as a professional associate in mathematics. In 1962 she began full-time work
as senior examiner in mathematics. In this position she was responsible for gradu-
ate record exams, advanced placement exams, upper level college board tests, the
original development of CLEP general mathematics examinations, development of
computer assisted assembly of tests, and was project director for actuarial exami-
nations. She became assistant director of the division in 1967 and associate director
in 1968. She noted in 1981 that during her years with mathematics test develop-
ment she worked closely with many mathematicians; she cited, in particular, A.
W. Tucker and Samuel Wilkes of Princeton University and E. P. Vance of Oberlin
College as having had special inﬂuence on her.

In 1973 Epstein moved to the College Board Programs Division of ETS, where she
continued her administrative work. She was director of development and analysis
1973–75, administrative director of professional services (test development, publica-
tions, statistical analysis, and systems) 1975–77, and vice president 1977–80. After
July 1980 she was senior advisor to the senior vice president for programs.

In connection with her work in educational testing, Epstein was engaged in
curriculum writing for the School Mathematics Study Group (SMSG) during the
summers of 1959 and 1960. She also served as consultant for test development
workshops with teachers of mathematics for the West African Examinations Council
in Ghana and Nigeria in the spring of 1964 and for the University of London School
Examinations Department in the spring of 1967. Other consulting work included
working with the NSF Institute for Teachers of Advanced Placement at Michigan
State University.

Epstein was active and inﬂuential in a number of positions related to education.
She was a member of the Princeton Township Board of Education 1955–66; she was
vice president 1958–61 and president 1961–63. She was on the New Jersey State
Board of Education 1966–77, as vice president 1975–77, chair of the legal committee
1975–77, and chair of the aﬃrmative action committee 1974–77. In 1971–73 Epstein
was co-chairperson of the Joint Committee on Postsecondary Vocational Education
for the New Jersey State Board of Education and the Board of Higher Education.
She was a member of the New Jersey Board of Higher Education 1973–77. In 1978
she became a member of the New Jersey Panel, American Council of Education
National Identiﬁcation Program for Women in Higher Education Administration,
and in 1980 she became a trustee of Kean College of New Jersey (now Kean Uni-
versity) and was appointed to the advisory council to the Princeton University

mathematics department. She was also a member of the American Association for
Higher Education and the American Personnel and Guidance Association.

In the 1950s, Epstein was active in the League of Women Voters, where she
served the Princeton chapter as vice president 1950–54 and president 1954–56. She
has also been a trustee of the Princeton Jewish Center and in 1979 became a
member of the National Education Committee of the American Jewish Committee.
She was elected secretary of Community Without Walls, a nonproﬁt association of
Princeton-area residents supporting senior citizens, when its ﬁrst governing body
was elected in 1995.

Jess Epstein died on December 30, 1998. He was survived by their three children
and seven grandchildren, among others. Marion Greenebaum Epstein continues to
live in the Princeton area.
