WOLF, Louise A. October 20, 1898–November 14, 1962.
University of Wisconsin (BA 1931, MA 1933, PhD 1935).

Louise Adelaide Wolf was the elder of two daughters, both born in Milwaukee, Wis-
consin, of Caroline (Kupperian) (1875–1973) and John Theodore Wolf (1872–1953). Her
mother, who was born in Germany and immigrated to the United States in 1892, and her
father, born in Milwaukee, were married in January 1898. Both were formally educated
through elementary school. In the 1900 census, her father’s occupation was listed as con-
ductor on the street railroad; later he was a truck gardener. Her younger sister, Margarete
Wolf (Hopkins), was born in November 1911 and also received a PhD in mathematics from
Wisconsin in 1935.

Louise Wolf attended the 26th Avenue School and, for three and a half years, South
Division High School, in Milwaukee. She attended Milwaukee-Downer College in 1915–16.
She then took a number of positions over the next dozen years. These included working in
a dental oﬃce and in a public library in Milwaukee, teaching two years in a district school
in Nevada, and working two years in Florida. She returned to college at the Milwaukee
Extension Division of the University of Wisconsin for the year 1928–29, when her younger
sister began college there. They both moved to the Madison campus the following year
to complete their undergraduate and graduate work. Louise Wolf was a member of the
junior mathematics club her junior and senior years in Madison and was its president her
senior year.

In October of her senior year, Warren Weaver wrote to the dean to request an assist-
antship for Louise Wolf. He noted that Miss Wolf was a senior mathematics major with
a straight A record in math. He ordinarily would not appoint a senior to such a position
but “Miss Wolf is an exceedingly capable woman, over 30 years of age, who has had expe-
rience in teaching and whose university education has been delayed by the fact that she is
helping educate a younger sister” (Warren Weaver to Dean Sellery, October 1, 1930, folder
1929–31, box 1, Budget Files, Department of Mathematics, College of Letters and Science,
University of Wisconsin–Madison Archives). Louise Wolf taught a course as an assistant
during the ﬁrst semester of her senior year and most subsequent semesters while she was
a student at Wisconsin. Typically she taught about three courses a year. She received her
bachelor’s degree in 1931 and ﬁnished the work for her master’s degree in 1933. During
her ﬁrst year as a graduate student, the mathematics department, acting as a sustaining
member of the AMS, nominated her for membership in the society. Louise Wolf and her
sister, Margarete, ﬁnished the work for their doctorates in 1935, both as students of Mark
H. Ingraham. In the early 1950s results from her dissertation and its published version,
1936, were cited by several authors.

Louise Wolf immediately took a position with the University of Wisconsin’s Extension
Division. She was engaged in circuit teaching her ﬁrst year and traveled regularly between
Milwaukee, Fond du Lac, Sheboygan, and Manitowoc giving instruction. Starting in 1936,
she taught at the Milwaukee Center, often referred to as the University of Wisconsin in
Milwaukee. Around the beginning of War War II she was also a lecturer at the University of
Wisconsin in Madison. In Milwaukee she was an instructor 1935–38, an assistant professor
until 1951, and an associate professor until her retirement as associate professor emeritus
in January 1962. In 1955 the Extension Division had merged with Wisconsin State College
to form the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee.

At her institution Louise Wolf served as faculty advisor to the junior mathematics club
several times in the 1930s. She and her sister prepared a talk for presentation to the AMS
in 1938. In the 1940s she became active in the Wisconsin Section of the MAA, initially
serving on program committees. She was ﬁrst elected secretary of the section in 1948 and
served in that capacity for the next ﬁve years. She also served on committees of NCTM
