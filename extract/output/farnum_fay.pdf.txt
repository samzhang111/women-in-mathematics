FARNUM, Fay. August 24, 1888–March 11, 1977.
Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (BS 1909), Cornell
University (MA 1915, PhD 1926).

Eugenia Fae Farnum, born in Spencer, Iowa, was the second of four children of
Josephine (Jacobs), born in 1857 in New York State, and George Edwin Farnum,
born in 1851 in New Hampshire. Her parents married in about 1875, and her father
was a farmer in northwestern Iowa at the time of the 1900 census. Her siblings
were an older brother, Roswell (1886–1917), and younger sisters, Anna (b. 1892)
and Martha B. (b. 1894). In 1920 the family was living in Ames, Iowa, where Fay
was an instructor at Iowa State College, Anna did clerical work for the Treasury
Department in Washington, D.C., and Martha was a college chemistry instructor.
Subsequently, Martha Belle Farnum received an MA in biology in 1922 and a PhD
in biochemistry in 1926 from the University of Chicago.

Farnum graduated with a degree in general science from Iowa State College of
Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (now Iowa State University of Science and Technol-
ogy) in 1909. Between 1909 and 1914 she taught in high schools in Lyons, LeMars,
and Ames, Iowa. She attended Cornell University 1914–15 and received her mas-
ter’s degree in 1915 having written her thesis using the name Fae Farnum. By the
late teens she used only the name Fay Farnum.

Farnum then returned to Iowa where she was an instructor at Iowa State 1915–
24. She attended the University of Chicago during the summers of 1921 and 1922.
She returned to study at Cornell during 1924–25 and registered only for thesis
supervision with Virgil Snyder in 1925–26. During her ﬁnal year, Farnum was an
instructor and taught two classes per semester including solid geometry, advanced
algebra, and calculus. She received her doctorate in 1926 with her major subject
geometry, her ﬁrst minor mathematical analysis, and her second minor physics.

Soon after receiving her doctorate, Farnum began a lengthy period of teach-
ing at Washington Square College, New York University. She served as instructor
1926–28 and then as assistant professor. During her early years at NYU, Farnum
often taught two graduate courses a semester, mainly geometry but sometimes al-
gebra or calculus of variations. By the mid-1930s she was more likely to teach two
undergraduate courses and one graduate course. One of her students at NYU was
Gertrude Blanch, for whom Farnum served as a reference when Blanch applied to
Cornell for graduate school. During 1939–40 Farnum took a leave of absence from
NYU to study at the Physics and Mathematics Institute in Copenhagen. She re-
ported to her father in Ames, Iowa, on the April 1940 Nazi invasion of Denmark
and described her trip back to the United States via Berlin, Munich, the Brenner
Pass, Milan, and Genoa, where she took the USS Manhattan to New York.

Farnum returned to NYU after her leave and taught for at least one more year,
1940–41; both the undergraduate and graduate bulletins list her as scheduled to
teach 1941–42. In 1943 she returned to the faculty of Iowa State, primarily to help
the mathematics department meet the extra teaching required by the naval and
army students. She was an assistant professor from 1943 to 1949, when she retired,
and taught again as assistant professor 1955–57.

Farnum was living at least part time in Tucson, Arizona, by about 1952. In 1957
she was appointed assistant professor at the University of Arizona and that year,

at age sixty-nine, rejoined the MAA, having let her membership lapse in the early
1940s. She died in Tucson at age eighty-eight and was survived by cousins. Her
obituary reported that she was a member of the First Congregational Church and
the AAUW and that she was buried in Tucson Memorial Park South Lawn.
