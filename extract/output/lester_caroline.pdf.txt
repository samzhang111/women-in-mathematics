LESTER, Caroline A. April 6, 1902–December 29, 1996.
Cornell University (BA 1924, MA 1928), University of Wisconsin (PhD 1937).

Caroline Avery Lester was born in Seneca Falls, New York, the daughter of
Elizabeth (Campbell) (1868–1943), originally of Racine, Wisconsin, and Frederick
William Lester (1870–1947) of Seneca Falls. Her mother had attended a school for
young ladies in New York City, and her father, a surgeon, had received his MD from
Columbia University in 1894. Her parents married in 1897. Other children of the
marriage were Lora (1898–1984), a bacteriologist with a BA from William Smith
College; John Campbell (1900–1984), a graduate of the US Naval Academy who
retired as a rear admiral and then taught engineering at Penn State; and Agnes
(1905–2000), who earned a BA from Cornell University in 1926.

Lester attended the First Ward School and the Mynderse Academy, public schools
in Seneca Falls, from kindergarten until her high school graduation in 1920. Years
later, in 1985, she reported that her ﬁrst motivation to pursue an education in
mathematics came from a high school teacher, Miss Reamer, who had studied engi-
neering at Cornell. Lester majored in mathematics at Cornell University, which she
attended on a free tuition scholarship from New York State. In 1924, the year of her
graduation, she was elected to Pi Lambda Theta, a national honor and professional
association in education, and to Phi Kappa Phi, a national honor society for all
disciplines. After her graduation she taught for three years in high schools in New
York State. During the summer of 1925 she studied education at Harvard Univer-
sity. In 1927 she returned to Cornell and enrolled with an intended mathematics
major and an education minor. At the end of the academic year she received her
master’s degree in mathematics.

In 1929 Lester went to the New York College for Teachers (now the State Uni-
versity of New York at Albany) as an instructor and remained there except for
subsequent leaves. She continued her graduate work in mathematics at the Univer-
sity of Chicago in the summers of 1933 and 1934 and was particularly motivated by
A. A. Albert in algebra. Expecting to have a sabbatical leave for the year 1935–36,
she applied to return to Cornell. Although accepted by Cornell, Lester decided not
to return there. Instead, she went to Ohio State University in the summer of 1935
to work under C. C. MacDuﬀee and then followed him to the University of Wis-
consin. She studied at Wisconsin the next two years while on leave from her job
and completed her work for the PhD under MacDuﬀee’s direction in 1937 with a
major in algebra and a minor in analysis. Lester traveled in Germany in the summer
of 1937 and then returned to her position in Albany, where she was promoted to
assistant professor by 1939 and to professor in 1950; she retired as emeritus profes-
sor in 1967. While at SUNY Albany, she produced manuscripts on “Modern Views
of Mathematics – Lectures on Groups, Rings and Fields” and on the “Theory of
Matrices.”

Lester was on leave from her position at Albany 1943–45, when she was a lieu-
tenant in the United States Coast Guard (Women’s Reserve). In a 1990 interview,
Lester described her entry into the military during World War II: “I was invited to
join the WAVES, but was turned down because of the physical exam. So, I turned
to the Coast Guard and was examined by a diﬀerent doctor and was found to be in
perfect health.” Commissioned in February 1943, she attended the US Coast Guard

Academy for a three-week course and then was stationed at the Naval Communica-
tions Annex in Washington, D.C., as a specialist in cryptanalysis from March 1943
through September 1945. She reported in her 1990 interview that she “decoded
messages from Spain, Portugal and North Africa.”

In May 1940 Lester was one of forty-three MAA members to petition for the
formation of a section for upstate New York. Lester served as vice chairman of the
Upper New York State Section, now called the Seaway Section, 1957–58 and as
chairman 1958–59. She was the second woman to serve in these positions; Harriet
Montague had been the ﬁrst. From 1948 to 1951 Lester served as an associate editor
of the American Mathematical Monthly.

In the early 1980s Lester moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, where her younger sister
was located. Lester was a member of the DAR, the National Society of Colonial
Dames of America, and the Mayﬂower Society. She was a Republican and a member
of a Presbyterian church and was especially interested in travel and bridge. Her
travels included at least four trips to Europe and two to Central America. Caroline
Avery Lester was ninety-four when she died in Indianapolis in 1996. She is buried
in the Restvale Cemetery in Seneca Falls, New York.
