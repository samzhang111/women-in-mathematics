HUGHES, Olive Margaret. December 13, 1899–December 29, 1936.
University of Saskatchewan (BA 1925, MA 1926), Bryn Mawr College (PhD
1934).

Olive Margaret Hughes was the daughter of Martha (Rogers) (1863–1948) and
Daniel Hughes (1860–1930), both originally from farm families in Wales. By 1886,
when their ﬁrst child, Eleanor (1886–1960), was born, they had a dairy shop in
London and lived there during the nearly twenty-year span when their eleven chil-
dren were born. Olive was born in London, the ninth in the family where, after the
ﬁrst girl, there were ﬁve boys followed by ﬁve girls. The other children were Richard
(1888–1958), William (ca. 1891–1947), (Daniel) Oscar (1892–1965), Vernon Austin
(1893–1970), Lewis Maurice (1894–1957), Blodwen (Dolly) (1896–1911), Winifred
(1898–1967), Norah (b. 1902), and Kathleen (1905–1969).

The family migration to Canada began in 1905 when the eldest son arrived in
western Saskatchewan, near Maidstone. Most other family members followed during
the next several years including the father and another son in 1908; the mother and
youngest daughter, Kathleen, in 1909; and ﬁnally the eldest daughter, Eleanor,
with Winifred, Olive, and Norah in 1912. The Hughes family farmed in western
Saskatchewan after their emigration from England.

Olive Hughes began her education in London. After her arrival in Canada at age
twelve, she attended the Dee Valley School, a one-room school house some distance
from their farm. According to a 1984 account by her younger sister Norah Dodds
in a local history, “Mother was getting a little worried because our attendance at
Dee Valley School was very irregular due to poor roads and bad weather” (Chain
of Memories, 80). Thus, in 1914, their mother rented a small house in North Bat-
tleford, about ﬁfty miles away, so the four youngest girls could attend school there.
Olive attended grades nine through eleven before teaching in the fall of 1917 at the
Dee Valley School with a permit from Regina, the provincial capital.

Hughes ﬁnished grade twelve in North Battleford and apparently attended Nor-
mal School in Saskatoon and then taught. She entered the University of Saskatch-
ewan, also in Saskatoon, in the fall of 1921 at age twenty-one and specialized in
mathematics under the direction of G. H. Ling and L. L. Dines. She completed
the standard three-year course in 1925, having taken oﬀ the year 1922–23. She was
granted a BA with high honors in mathematics in 1925. She was vice president and
president, respectively, of the university mathematical society during her last two
years as an undergraduate, and was an assistant in the department her last year.
The summer following her graduation, she studied mathematics at the University of
Chicago and then returned to the University of Saskatchewan as a graduate student
and assistant in the mathematics department. She received her master’s degree in
1926.

Hughes remained at the university the next two years as an instructor and served
as the faculty advisor to the mathematical society at least in 1927–28. She studied
mathematics at the University of Chicago again during the summer of 1927.

Olive Hughes’s enrollment at the University of Saskatchewan overlapped with
that of her next older sister Winifred, who earned a BA with honors in biology
in 1922 and an MA in 1924. Winifred Hughes earned a PhD in biology from the
University of Chicago in 1929 and subsequently was professor of zoology at the

University of Alberta. Apparently these were the only Hughes children to receive
regular university degrees.

Olive Hughes left her instructorship at the University of Saskatchewan at the
end of the academic year 1927–28 to accept a fellowship at Bryn Mawr College. She
studied at Bryn Mawr 1928–31, the ﬁrst two years as a resident fellow. She took
mathematics as her major subject and physics as her independent minor. Her PhD
was granted in 1934, with her dissertation having been completed in 1931 under
the direction of Anna Pell Wheeler.

According to the Bryn Mawr College 1934 commencement program, Hughes was
principal of the Islay School District in Alberta, Canada, 1931–34. Records supplied
by Allen Ronaghan, a Canadian historian associated with the museum of the school
in Islay, indicate that she was there 1932–34, and that she taught grades seven
through ten in one room of the two-room school. Mr. Ronaghan contacted three of
her former students who commented on some aspects of her teaching at Islay. Their
remarks included that she was “very intellectual,” “very well prepared as a teacher,”
“kept to herself and did not go out into the community,” “smoked cigarettes in
secret,” “read many books,” and “stayed at school late, either preparing her class
work or reading her own assignments.”

It is unclear what Hughes did after receiving her PhD in 1934, although Bryn
Mawr records show that she was residing on East Chestnut Street in Chicago,
Illinois, in 1935. It is possible that she was with her sister Kathleen Hughes, who
was working as a commercial artist in Chicago at that time according to the Hughes
entry in Chain of Memories. Many years after Olive Hughes’s death, a 1950 Bryn
Mawr directory listed her address as in care of her sister Winifred in Edmonton,
Alberta, about 135 miles west of her last conﬁrmed address in Islay.

An extensive search for information about the date, place, and cause of her death
has resulted only in the following, written by her sister Norah: “Her untimely demise
in 1936 was due to a bus-train collision” (Chain of Memories, 83). The grave marker
at the cemetery in Maidstone, Saskatchewan, reads:
