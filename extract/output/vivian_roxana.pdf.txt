VIVIAN, Roxana H. December 9, 1871–May 31, 1961.
Wellesley College (BA 1894), University of Pennsylvania (PhD 1901).

Roxana Hayward Vivian was the daughter of Roxana (Nott), born in 1848 in New
Hampshire, and Robert Hayward Vivian, born in 1843 in Nova Scotia, Canada, a tailor.
Her parents married in about 1870. She was born in Hyde Park (now part of Boston),
Massachusetts, the eldest of three daughters, all born in Massachusetts. Her sisters were
Anna G. (b. ca. 1874), a teacher in 1900, and Margaret W. (b. 1878).

Roxana Vivian attended public schools in Hyde Park. She gave the salutatory address
at her graduation from the Grew School in 1886 and graduated from Hyde Park High
School in 1890. She then enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in Greek and
mathematics before graduating in 1894. She taught in the Stoughton, Massachusetts, pub-
lic high school for the year 1894–95. Vivian held a secondary school teaching certiﬁcate
and after the year of teaching took the examination for Boston High School Class A prin-
cipal’s certiﬁcation. She then taught Greek and mathematics 1896–98 at the Walnut Hill
School, a private boarding school in Natick, Massachusetts, while also pursuing graduate
work in those subjects at Wellesley.

Vivian spent the years 1898–1901 as an alumnae fellow for women at the University of
Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. She received her PhD in 1901 with a minor in astronomy,
having been presented to the faculty of the university by the chairman of the mathematics
department, Edwin Cawley. The method of presentation was new in 1901 and was de-
scribed in an article in Science: the candidate “is presented by the professor under whom
he has taken his major subject. The presentor reads a sketch of the candidate’s academic
life and an outline of the scope and contents of his thesis, after which any member of
the faculty may make enquiries of the candidate or the presentor” (n.s. 14 (1901): 334).
An example of the credentials of a candidate from each science was given, with those of
Roxana Vivian representing mathematics.

After receiving her PhD, Vivian returned to Wellesley as instructor; she was the ﬁrst
member of the mathematics department to possess a doctorate. She made what was prob-
ably the ﬁrst of many trips to Europe in summer 1902. In addition to her regular teaching
assignments, Vivian was a reader for the College Entrance Examination Board in 1904.

Roxana Vivian was granted a leave of absence from Wellesley for the academic year
1906–07 to teach in Turkey at the American College for Girls (also known as Constantino-
ple Woman’s College). She continued her leave for 1907–09 to remain as acting president
of the school while the president was in New York raising funds for the college. In 1908,
while still in Turkey, Vivian was promoted to associate professor at Wellesley. She returned
to Wellesley in 1909, having weathered a precarious time in Turkey because of the Young
Turks Revolution in 1908. She described the situation in a “life history” she wrote in 1949
for the Wellesley College seventy-ﬁfth anniversary. “Those three years . . . were worth a
great deal to me, teaching girls of thirteen nationalities and being in charge at a dangerous
interval when I slept with my revolver and cartridge belt by my bedside, ready to take
charge of four or ﬁve armed men, servants and night guards” (Wellesley College Archives).
Vivian spent a summer, most likely in 1912, at Cold Spring Harbor, New York, prepar-
ing to teach a course in statistics that had been suggested by a member of the economics
department at Wellesley. In 1914 her ﬁrst statistical article appeared. This article was
coauthored with J. Arthur Harris, a botanist and biometrician at the Station for the
Experimental Study of Evolution at Cold Spring Harbor.

In 1913–15 Vivian had a partial leave of absence from Wellesley and reduced her teach-
ing load to a one-hour course while she worked as ﬁnancial secretary of the Women’s
Educational and Industrial Union (WEIU), a non-proﬁt social and educational agency
that was concerned with training, placement, and legal protection for working women in
Boston. In 1913–14 she gave an extension course in statistics for Boston University, and

in connection with her work with WEIU, she published another statistical article in 1916.
Vivian continued her interest in statistics in social science and in 1924 published a book
about the distribution of college students among the states.

In 1918 Vivian was promoted to professor and was appointed director of Wellesley’s
department of hygiene and physical education. She again had a leave from Wellesley’s
mathematics department and served as director until 1921, when she returned to the
mathematics department. In the years 1922–25 she was chairman of the committee on
investments for the Wellesley College Alumnae Association. During 1925–26 she visited
Cornell University and attended classes in algebra, complex variables, diﬀerential equa-
tions, geometry, and probability and statistics. She left Wellesley in 1927. That summer
Vivian made a lengthy trip that included a visit to Constantinople and countries around
the Mediterranean.

Vivian spent the spring and summer of 1928 organizing and equipping the Eagle Wing
School, a private college preparatory school for girls in Orleans, Massachusetts; her title
there was principal. The school was unable to open because of ﬁnancial circumstances. She
then spent the year 1928–29 teaching mathematics in Oak Grove Seminary, a private school
in Vassalboro, Maine. In 1929 she accepted the position of professor recently vacated by
Mary Gertrude Haseman at Hartwick College in Oneonta, New York. Vivian also served in
the newly created position of dean of women 1929–30; she resigned her professorship and
left the college at the end of the ﬁrst semester 1930–31. She was replaced in fall 1931 by
Hazel Schoonmaker (Wilson). Vivian was next instructor and dean of girls at Rye Public
High School, also in New York, 1931–35.

Vivian’s reports to Wellesley over the years indicate that sometime after she left the
college, she spent three or four winters in Chicago with her Wellesley freshman roommate,
Ada Belﬁeld, and several winters in Stamford, Connecticut. In a May 1940 letter to Helen
B. Owens, Vivian wrote that “my life consists in visiting and in serving my invalid family
members as I can — they are in Wellesley and South Natick. . . . With such a schedule as
this you can see that I did not succeed in ﬁnding any professional opening after 1935”
(Owens Papers). A later report to Wellesley notes that she motored across the country
one summer in the early 1940s. In 1952, when she was eighty, she reported to Wellesley
that she had spent two years in Greece and was then helping in an oﬃce of statistics at
a Red Cross blood bank; she was also guiding visitors on Friday afternoons in Trinity
Church, Boston. Vivian belonged to the Boston College Club and was an Episcopalian
and a Republican.

Roxana H. Vivian died at age eighty-nine in 1961 at the Sophia Snow House of the
Roxbury Home for Aged Women in the Roslindale neighborhood of Boston. She was buried
in Newburyport, Massachusetts.
