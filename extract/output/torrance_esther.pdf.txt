TORRANCE, Esther (McCormick). August 12, 1909–January 3, 1978.
Barnard College (BA 1931), Cornell University (MA 1932), Brown University
(PhD 1939).

Esther Ober McCormick was the elder of two surviving children of Ethel Mary (Ober),
born in Ohio in 1879, and Thomas Holmes McCormick, born in Indiana in 1875. Her
parents were both students at Hiram College in Ohio; her mother was there for one year,
1900–01, and her father graduated in 1902, shortly before their marriage in June of that
year. Their ﬁrst daughter died in infancy.

Esther McCormick was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where her father was a mathe-
matics teacher at Fort Wayne High School. At some point her mother gave guitar lessons.
Her younger brother, Edgar T. McCormick (1914–1991), was born in New York City after
the family moved there in the summer of 1913. Edgar McCormick later attended Princeton
University and became an analyst for Prudential Life Insurance. An avid and successful
chess player, he also was chess team coach for Prudential. For a few years, the family lived
in New York City where her father was a teacher of mathematics at the Commercial High
School and occasionally served as a substitute preacher. He continued to teach at the high
school after the family moved to East Orange, New Jersey. Esther McCormick graduated
from Eastern Grammar School in East Orange in 1923 and from East Orange High School
in 1927.

McCormick attended Barnard College, Columbia University, where she majored in
mathematics and studied primarily with Lulu Hofmann (Bechtolsheim) and Edward Kas-
ner. She took several graduate courses at Columbia in addition to her undergraduate work.
She joined the AMS in the summer of 1930 and attended two meetings of the society before
she received her bachelor’s degree in February 1931.

She immediately entered graduate school at Cornell for the second term of the academic
year 1930–31 and returned to Columbia for graduate work during the summer of 1931.
She had a graduate scholarship at Cornell for 1931–32 and received her master’s degree
in February 1932, having done her work in geometry and written her master’s thesis with
Virgil Snyder. She stayed at Cornell through the end of that academic year before going
to Brown University for the year 1932–33 with a scholarship and part-time work.

While a student at Cornell, McCormick met Charles Chapman Torrance, who had
received a PhD in mathematics from Cornell in 1931 and was an instructor there from
1927 until 1931. C. C. Torrance (1902–1967) was born in Yonkers, New York, and had
earned an ME in 1922 and an MA in 1927 from Cornell. He spent 1931–32 as an instructor
at Stanford and 1933–34 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. During 1933–
34 Esther McCormick traveled in Europe before marrying Charles Torrance on June 19,
1934. A daughter later reported that a professor at Cornell told her that Charles was
brilliant, and that the best contribution she could make to the world of mathematics was
to marry him and keep him happy and productive.

C. C. Torrance was a member of the faculty at Case School of Applied Science in
Cleveland, Ohio, from 1934 until 1946 and was a contract mathematician at the Bureau
of Ordnance of the Navy Department at Washington, D.C., 1944–45. At Case he was
instructor 1934–40, assistant professor 1940–44, and associate professor 1945–46.

Esther Torrance was an instructor at Oberlin College 1937–38. Both of the Torrances
were in residence at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton during 1938–39. A
daughter reported that hers was a courtesy invitation while C. C. Torrance was working
with von Neumann. During that year Charles and Esther Torrance translated an article
by Arnaud Denjoy of the Institut Henri Poincar´e that appeared in the Duke Mathematical
Journal. Esther Torrance ﬁnished the work for her PhD at Brown in 1939.

After several miscarriages, two daughters were born, both of whom later earned doctor-
ates. Ellen McCormick was born in March 1941, did her undergraduate work at Barnard,

received a master’s degree from Stanford, and received a PhD in mathematics in 1968 from
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Wendy was born in April 1942, did her
undergraduate work at Occidental College in Los Angeles, and received a PhD in physics
in 1971, also from the University of Illinois.

In 1946 C. C. Torrance moved to the Naval Postgraduate School in Annapolis, Mary-
land, and was associate professor 1946–50 and professor 1950 until his retirement in May
1967. When the school moved to Monterey, California, in December 1951, the Torrances
moved to the West Coast. Esther Torrance taught in high school in Salinas for a brief
time in the late 1950s or early 1960s. Her husband died very soon after his retirement,
and afterwards Esther Torrance moved to Fresno. She was assistant professor at Fresno
State College (California State University, Fresno since 1972) from 1967 until her retire-
ment in 1972, after an unsuccessful bid for tenure. She moved back to Monterey after her
retirement.

Esther Torrance was described by her younger daughter as “formal and forbidding, but
would go way out of her way to be of service.” When they lived in Annapolis, she was par-
ticularly active in a number of community organizations, serving as an advisory member
of the Anne Arundel Youth Commission, as a member of the Annapolis Planning Com-
mission, and on the board of directors of the Citizens Planning and Housing Association
of Annapolis and Anne Arundel County. She was also a registered lobbyist in Congress
for a housing coalition. According to her younger daughter, “she idolized Jane Addams
of Hull House.” She played the stock market for both fun and proﬁt and played chess by
mail and bridge. She loved long walks and camping in Yosemite, where every summer she
and the girls would camp two to three weeks and be joined by her husband for a shorter
time. In August 1977, a few months before her death, she climbed Mt. Whitney, the tallest
mountain in the contiguous United States. At this time, too, she was working for passage
of the ERA. She was a member of the Disciples of Christ and was active in the Paciﬁc
Grove church.

After a series of strokes and heart attacks in December 1977 and early January 1978,

Esther Torrance died in January 1978 at age sixty-eight in Monterey, California.
